data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-00.png	Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-01.png	Lancaster House despite the crisis which had
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-02.png	blown up. He has now revealed his full plans
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-03.png	to the Africans and Liberals attending. These
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-04.png	plans do not give the Africans the overall
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-05.png	majority they are seeking. African delegates
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-06.png	are studying them today. The conference
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-07.png	will meet to discuss the function of a
data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-08.png	proposed House of Chiefs.
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-00.png	MR. IAIN MACLEOD, the Colonial Secretary, denied
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-01.png	in the Commons last night that there have been
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-02.png	secret negotiations on Northern Rhodesia's future.
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-03.png	The Northern Rhodesia conference in London has
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-04.png	been boycotted by the two main settlers' parties -
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-05.png	the United Federal Party and the Dominion Party.
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-06.png	But representatives of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-07.png	Minister of the Central African Federation, went
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-08.png	to Chequers at the week-end for talks with
data/a01/a01-026/a01-026-09.png	Mr. Macmillan.
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-00.png	And, since this is election year in West
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-01.png	Germany, Dr. Adenauer is in a tough
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-02.png	spot. Joyce Egginton cables: President
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-03.png	Kennedy at his Washington Press con-
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-04.png	ference admitted he did not know
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-05.png	whether America was lagging behind
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-06.png	Russia in missile power. He said he
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-07.png	was waiting for his senior military
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-08.png	aides to come up with the answer on
data/a01/a01-077/a01-077-09.png	February 20.
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-00.png	The result of the vote was not in
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-01.png	doubt. For the Tories were massed
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-02.png	in answer to their whips to defeat a
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-03.png	censure motion on the Government for
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-04.png	&quot;undermining the Health Service&quot; and
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-05.png	placing heavy burdens on those least
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-06.png	able to bear them. Mr. Brown
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-07.png	declared that the policy under censure
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-08.png	was monstrous. It had offended many
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-09.png	people far beyond the ranks of Labour
data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-10.png	supporters.
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-00.png	&quot;After a lifetime of helping others and
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-01.png	healing the sick, my considered
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-02.png	opinion is that anybody supporting
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-03.png	the increased charges is a wicked,
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-04.png	old -.&quot; Mr. Brown went on: &quot;We
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-05.png	are dealing with a noble edifice which
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-06.png	needs an imaginative architect to
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-07.png	improve it, but it has got a
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-08.png	quantity surveyor. We have descended
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-09.png	from the real problems to fiddling about
data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-10.png	with bills of cost.
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-00.png	Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted, led
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-01.png	Labour's attack on the higher health
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-02.png	charges. Mr. Powell, white-faced and outwardly
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-03.png	unemotional, replied with a statistical state-
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-04.png	ment - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-05.png	to angry uproar. One dealt with the human
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-06.png	issue behind the Health Service; the other
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-07.png	tried to show that the balance-sheet must
data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-08.png	always come first.
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-00.png	A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine, paid
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-01.png	for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament.
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-02.png	Those who lend their names to this kind of
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-03.png	advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-04.png	of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-05.png	idea that moral regeneration would solve
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-06.png	all our problems. So it would. While we are
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-07.png	waiting for the millenium, however, most of us
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-08.png	would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-09.png	instruments of democracy, such as trade unions
data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-10.png	and our local and national Parliaments.
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-00.png	Should the Herald publish such advertisements?
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-01.png	This is a difficult question. It would obviously
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-02.png	be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-03.png	which we disagree. When an advertisement
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-04.png	contains statements whose factual truth is
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-05.png	doubtful, or where the total content would be
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-06.png	deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-07.png	exercise editorial discretion. The MRA
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-08.png	advertisement falls into neither category, though
data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-09.png	many readers will dislike it.
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-00.png	Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys,
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-01.png	Commonwealth Relations Secretary, that they wish to be kept
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-02.png	in touch in London. Three of them - Canada, Australia,
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-03.png	New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-04.png	meeting in London on Monday. Once the Common
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-05.png	Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-06.png	for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-07.png	countries can arrange for observers to advise the British
data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-08.png	negotiating team.
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-00.png	A third man's house was watched for four days
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-01.png	by plain-clothes men. Committee-member Mr. George
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-02.png	Clark commented at a Press conference: &quot;The
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-03.png	most extraordinary things are happening.&quot; Fifty
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-04.png	committee members will appear at Bow-street
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-05.png	today, including Lord Russell, Lady Russell,
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-06.png	Lord Boyd-Orr, the Rev. Michael Scott, and
data/a02/a02-062/a02-062-07.png	Mr. Clark.
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-00.png	The possibility that the Government might
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-01.png	invoke the Public Order Act, 1936, and
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-02.png	declare the whole rally illegal - whether
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-03.png	the demonstrators sit down or not - was
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-04.png	being discussed in Whitehall last night.
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-05.png	It was last used a year ago, to deal
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-06.png	with the St. Pancras rent riots. Today
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-07.png	Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-08.png	Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-09.png	draw up final plans for the "Battle
data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-10.png	of Parliament Square."
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-00.png	In some ways it will be a testing occasion
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-01.png	for him, although some think his position
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-02.png	unassailable simply because there is no one
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-03.png	else in sight to supplant him. So the con-
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-04.png	ference will concentrate on laying the
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-05.png	foundations on which to win the next
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-06.png	election. The rally comes at a time
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-07.png	when in spite of carefully worded state-
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-08.png	ments by the Prime Minister there is an
data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-09.png	air of electoral expectancy.
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-00.png	Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-01.png	of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-02.png	sure the Labour movement was coming round in
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-03.png	support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-04.png	widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-05.png	Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-06.png	supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-07.png	their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-08.png	to the missile.
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-00.png	Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-01.png	not deny facilities to nations to which it was
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-02.png	allied. But governments should be free to negotiate
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-03.png	and refuse proposals with which they did not
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-04.png	agree. The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because,
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-05.png	he said, they were out of date and vulnerable and
data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-06.png	would attract enemy action.
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-00.png	That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine.
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-01.png	So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons,
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-02.png	the West, somewhere, must have them too. It
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-03.png	was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-04.png	purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-05.png	This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-06.png	to oppose the Polaris depot ship.
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-00.png	The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-01.png	in the Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-02.png	city with two million people. It should be sited
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-03.png	in a more remote area. Mr. Gaitskell added that
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-04.png	the Scarborough conference decisions did not, in his
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-05.png	view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-06.png	of party members and still less the party's
data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-07.png	supporters in the country.
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-00.png	Short of wearing the same uniform, which is
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-01.png	not contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-02.png	Air Force would become, for practical purposes,
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-03.png	a single defence force. There would be
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-04.png	complete co-operation at all levels in training
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-05.png	and operations. This would apply also in the
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-06.png	command structure and central administrative
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-07.png	organisation. Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence,
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-08.png	has been working on the plan for some months,
data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-09.png	with the Prime Minister's approval.
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-00.png	He has had numerous meetings with the Service
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-01.png	Ministers. He has also had talks with the Earl
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-02.png	of Home, Foreign Secretary, and with other
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-03.png	Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-04.png	of defence policy. Details of the scheme
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-05.png	are now being worked out by the Chiefs
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-06.png	of Staff, a process that may take four
data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-07.png	or five months.
data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-00.png	They nodded at each other and Sir Edward
data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-01.png	rose to say that the Chancellor would bear
data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-02.png	Mr. Wilson's offer in mind. Guy Eden writes:
data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-03.png	Treasury experts are already working on
data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-04.png	the scheme. Profits of genuine investors
data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-05.png	in industry will not be affected, but only

data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-00.png	The big &quot;squeeze&quot; means that it is going to be more
data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-01.png	difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft. And banks will be
data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-02.png	stricter in recalling existing overdrafts. This is underlined in

data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-04.png	with its militarists and revenge-seekers, is becoming a
data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-05.png	hotbed of war danger in Europe. Even now, aided by
data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-06.png	the U.S., Britain and France, it has more than enough
data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-07.png	forces and arms to touch off a world war.
data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-00.png	BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being

data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-03.png	realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-04.png	of a third world war. The best way to rule out such a tragic
data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-05.png	contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous
data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-06.png	growth of West Berlin's occupation status.
data/a06/a06-157/a06-157-00.png	This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
data/a06/a06-157/a06-157-01.png	East German disturbances on July 17, 1953. And officials
data/a06/a06-157/a06-157-02.png	fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps.
data/a06/a06-157/a06-157-03.png	They will overflow and private houses will have to be used.
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-00.png	WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-01.png	when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-02.png	of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-03.png	20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin. An eye-
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-04.png	witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-05.png	the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti-
data/e07/e07-000/e07-000-06.png	cide poisoning.
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-00.png	THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-01.png	tonight from their tour in the East. The duke's
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-02.png	trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-03.png	have taken the headlines in this country.
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-04.png	Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-05.png	success. The Queen has won a triumph. It
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-06.png	would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-07.png	performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-08.png	dropped from future Royal programmes.
data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-00.png	But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-01.png	their visit. The warmth of their welcome in India and
data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-02.png	Pakistan are happy memories. WEST GERMANY - followed
data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-03.png	yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-04.png	of a good neighbour. She has put up the value
data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-05.png	of her money.
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-00.png	Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-01.png	in the direction of live-and-let-live. Hopes
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-02.png	will now grow brighter of further international
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-03.png	co-operation, which is the only way to solve the
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-04.png	payments difficulties that upset the Western world.
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-05.png	Britain and the U.S., which have problems with
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-06.png	their balances, will gain some immediate help.
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-07.png	What it means in practical terms is that our
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-08.png	exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-09.png	for Germans to buy, while the goods which
data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-10.png	Germany exports will be made a little dearer.
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-00.png	It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-01.png	at the moment &quot;an awful mess up&quot; in
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-02.png	the measurement of temperatures. This,
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-03.png	however, seems a matter of the convenience
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-04.png	of specialists. The ordinary British man
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-05.png	and woman is conscious of no difficulty.
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-06.png	Rather than fifty million people having
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-07.png	to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-08.png	any reason why the centigrade countries
data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-09.png	should not change to fahrenheit?
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-00.png	Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-01.png	strably better than the other? The centigraders may
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-02.png	be in for a stiffer fight than they think. They may
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-03.png	have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market.
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-04.png	Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-05.png	public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-06.png	circumstances the time would come when this would
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-07.png	suit their convenience - rather than to change their
data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-08.png	system of recording temperatures.
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-00.png	The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-01.png	Britain today! &quot;THIS is colour day,&quot; proclaimed the American
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-02.png	television network, N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-03.png	programmes in bright colours. In America colour TV is five years
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-04.png	old. There are already 600,000 sets in use. What about Britain?
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-05.png	The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service, but the
data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-06.png	commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years.
data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-00.png	The Government should settle this argument with two words to
data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-01.png	the B.B.C.: - Go ahead! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-02.png	by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-03.png	they had to leave their cottage. Mr. John Crabb, clerk to
data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-04.png	Newmarket urban council, says: "I shall always feel this as a
data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-05.png	personal failure."
data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-00.png	There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself. The
data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-01.png	sisters had to quit as their home was falling down. And Mr. Crabb
data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-02.png	did his best for them, even driving them to a new house. John
data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-03.png	Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding. Too
data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-04.png	often lacking in officialdom. MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-05.png	does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman.
data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-00.png	He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-01.png	be in England. The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-02.png	Scot. The Lord Chancellor is a Scot. The Prime Minister is a
data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-03.png	Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century.
data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-04.png	Let Mr. Newton beware. By protesting against Scotland he
data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-05.png	may be guilty of rebellion!
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-00.png	ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial.
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-01.png	His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-02.png	five years. During this period Britain will be expected
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-03.png	to subsidise and defend the Cypriots. They will enjoy
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-04.png	all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference. It is a
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-05.png	safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-06.png	company will sign on again.
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-00.png	It is equally certain that the British Government
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-01.png	will welcome them. How splendid it would be if, just
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-02.png	for once, the Government were to voice the real feelings of
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-03.png	the British people. And tell Makarios they are not
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-04.png	prepared to accept him on such terms. GOOD cheer
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-05.png	for the week-end. Ford Motors are to put 13,000
data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-06.png	men back on a five-day week.
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-00.png	One more demonstration of the industry's recovery. As
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-01.png	springtime approaches, orders pick up. And the car men get
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-02.png	ready for another bustling season. The pessimists
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-03.png	said the motor industry was on its knees. The optimists
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-04.png	said &quot;Nonsense.&quot; As usual, the optimists have been
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-05.png	proved right. EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-06.png	hit on an original way of spending this afternoon.
data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-00.png	They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence. It is
data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-01.png	their protest against the H-bomb. They ought to have a
data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-02.png	pleasant time. The weather forecast is good; except for them,
data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-03.png	Whitehall should be deserted. And they will have a fine view
data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-04.png	of St. James's Park, with its placid lake, pelicans,
data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-05.png	rare ducks, and other wild life.
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-00.png	HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-01.png	in Rhodesia! Eighteen months ago this territory
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-02.png	was peaceful, orderly, and thriving. Africans within the
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-03.png	Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-04.png	administration. Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-05.png	Secretary. Suddenly everything changed. Timetables were
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-06.png	scrapped. The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-07.png	rushed out to Rhodesia. Overnight, minor African
data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-08.png	politicians were inflated into international figures.
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-00.png	And as the British Government stepped up the pace
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-01.png	of change, so the Africans stepped up their demands.
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-02.png	TODAY, in London, that rash and thoughtless policy has
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-03.png	caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened.
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-04.png	No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching.
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-05.png	If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-06.png	Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-07.png	difficulties from African politicians greedy for power.
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-00.png	But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-01.png	be plunged into chaos, like the Congo. For Mr.
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-02.png	Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice. They
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-03.png	must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos. And try to
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-04.png	repair the damage they have done. WHO can grow the
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-05.png	fastest? That is the exciting competition going on
data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-06.png	among Britain's major industries.
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-00.png	Top of the table, at the moment, is the chemical industry.
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-01.png	Then comes engineering, followed by iron and steel.
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-02.png	Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-03.png	tremendous upsurge in investment. It reports that new
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-04.png	factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-05.png	up on 1960. Britain's business men are right to back
data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-06.png	their faith with cash.
data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-00.png	Nobody's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around!&quot; He then
data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-01.png	took out a piece of paper, wrote his address on it and added:
data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-02.png	&quot;Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me
data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-03.png	first. I won't stand for it.&quot; Exit a puzzled American.
data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-04.png	The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg
data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-05.png	to Paris.
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-00.png	The production by Bill Duncalf
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-01.png	compressed a long and sometimes rambling
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-02.png	story into a concentrated comprehensive
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-03.png	survey of a life work. P. J. K. HANS WERNER
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-04.png	HENZE'S &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; is the first
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-05.png	unambiguously &quot;contemporary&quot; work to be
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-06.png	admitted to the Glyndebourne canon. By no
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-07.png	means a masterpiece, it is in many respects
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-08.png	a representative modern work and the composer
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-09.png	is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-10.png	idioms, with a strong sense of words and situation.
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-00.png	The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman,
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-01.png	is largely a satire on the petty court
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-02.png	surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-03.png	egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-04.png	everything to his need of inspiration. Henze
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-05.png	obtains his musical characterisation by means
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-06.png	of individual instrumental timbres and &quot;personal&quot;
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-07.png	intervals, and the result is often less delineation
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-08.png	of character than caricature. This is also the chief,
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-09.png	or at least the most successfully executed trait
data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-10.png	of the libretto, which contains an odd blend of highly
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-00.png	A summary of the story can give almost
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-01.png	indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry. He
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-02.png	tells his story best in the faces of his crowds,
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-03.png	recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-04.png	with brutal honesty, building up to a
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-05.png	tremendous climax in the island orgy.
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-06.png	Here, the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts,
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-07.png	the wildly flapping white sails slashed by
data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-08.png	the glaring beacon of a lighthouse.

data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-01.png	Prizes being what they are, Berlin is unusually
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-02.png	generous in giving everyone something, and silver
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-03.png	bears are awarded in every direction. Both the
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-04.png	Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours,
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-05.png	and the audience at the awards was particularly
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-06.png	enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-07.png	as best actress for her work in the Godard
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-08.png	film. Gifted with an interesting face, although little
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-09.png	acting ability, she would seem to be well
data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-10.png	worth watching in the months to come.
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-00.png	It has a great look of speed and technical fun
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-01.png	about it, of enormous cinematic enjoyment, and
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-02.png	above all of cinematic sense. Much of it has
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-03.png	that air of improvisation, as of off-the-cuff
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-04.png	living, that once seemed so new and so
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-05.png	attractive. The story (not that the story, in the
data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-06.png	sense of plot, matters much; but in the sense of

data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-01.png	was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe

data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-03.png	a cardboard role, didn't stand a chance. Now comes
data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-04.png	&quot;The Right Approach&quot; (Rialto, &quot;A&quot;), and it's a glum
data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-05.png	business. He plays an aspiring actor - a
data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-06.png	selfish, arrogant, brash, ambitious, unscrupulous heel -
data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-07.png	who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-08.png	the Hollywood ratrace.

data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-02.png	&quot;Drama '61&quot; last night as a smooth,

data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-05.png	by Quentin Lawrence, here, held together
data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-06.png	by Mr. Houston's accomplished
data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-07.png	performance as the master mind behind a

data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-00.png	This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-01.png	worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious. The play
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-02.png	had style, moved at a quick pace and everyone did
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-03.png	well. But it was Mr. Houston's evening.
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-04.png	Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-05.png	Holloway's act too long and not particularly
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-06.png	entertaining. It was also a mistake to
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-07.png	re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-08.png	so soon after their previous appearance.
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-00.png	Most of those who expound a theory of textual
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-01.png	dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-02.png	written entirely by one author before the
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-03.png	disturbance took place but a few leave it open
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-04.png	to suppose that the original book had been
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-05.png	revised even before the upheaval. The ingenuity
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-06.png	of the theories is impressive and is the best
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-07.png	argument against them.
data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-08.png	Thomas Spreng
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-00.png	The one real weakness of the Commentator's
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-01.png	case is that, in common with all his colleagues,
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-02.png	he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-03.png	how this enlargement was effected nor has he
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-04.png	been able to explain the textual movements by
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-05.png	showing that such changes are part of a
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-06.png	simple and coherent plan. To understand how
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-07.png	this is possible it is necessary to examine the
data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-08.png	text of the Gospel.
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-00.png	THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-01.png	written in Greek. A modern text of the
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-02.png	Gospel represents the work of generations of
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-03.png	scholars who have compared the many manu-
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-04.png	scripts of John and worked out the version
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-05.png	which is most likely to have been the original
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-06.png	wording. It is not possible to establish any one
data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-07.png	text with absolute precision.
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-00.png	Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-01.png	might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-02.png	whether or not a particular text was written on
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-03.png	a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-04.png	writing, but any papyrus left unused at the
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-05.png	end could be cut off. If the text was longer than
data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-06.png	the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-00.png	The verso of the roll was blank, and one
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-01.png	cannot think of an author, Mark for example,
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-02.png	sending out his Gospel lacking the ending,
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-03.png	while one whole side of his roll was unused.
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-04.png	The codex form was not so accommodating. Even
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-05.png	in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-06.png	sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-07.png	over the binding, or the whole codex rebound.
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-00.png	One can remember with horror the pictures of the
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-01.png	overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-02.png	complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantel-
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-03.png	piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-04.png	numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-05.png	after the Victorian period that designers realised
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-06.png	the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-07.png	revived with designs suitable for contemporary
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-08.png	trends. Crochet today has a variety of uses, and
data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-09.png	has even stepped into the field of high fashion.
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-00.png	A natural transition from gardens and
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-01.png	orchards to the vital question of water
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-02.png	supply. The pools are probably natural springs
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-03.png	enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-04.png	the rock. King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-05.png	construction in lines 9, 23-25 of the Moabite Stone,
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-06.png	which read: And I built Baal-meon and made
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-07.png	in it the reservoir... and I made both the
data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-08.png	reservoirs for water inside the town.
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-00.png	According to the legend, Solomon had asked the
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-01.png	Prince of the Demons, &quot;Ashmodeus&quot; to bring him
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-02.png	the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-03.png	Shamir had not been placed under his charge, as
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-04.png	there is no Shamir in Gehenna (Hell). An eagle
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-05.png	brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden,
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-06.png	the Paradise, the only place where the Shamir
data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-07.png	could be found.
data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-00.png	The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-01.png	a sanctuary, and only some rare birds know
data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-02.png	the existence of it. These birds are, the Cherubim
data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-03.png	and the Seraphim. We are also told that the Shamir
data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-04.png	is the stylus used by Moses, and this stylus is described
data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-05.png	as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant.
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-00.png	The word Shamir was used as a
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-01.png	personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-02.png	word &quot;SHAMIR&quot; means guarded or preser-
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-03.png	ved. Therefore, the real man, who
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-04.png	regards himself as insignificant, as the
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-05.png	prayer says: &quot;What am I? A worm&quot;, he
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-06.png	is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-07.png	the Shmah, loves the Lord God with
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-08.png	all his heart, and with all his soul and
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-09.png	with all his might and studies the
data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-10.png	word of God.
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-00.png	This man is the worm, the creature that
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-01.png	cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-02.png	a man is the Shamir that guards him-
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-03.png	self against all the irrelevant pleasures.
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-04.png	Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-05.png	to mould our character, to melt our
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-06.png	heart of stone. This Shamir helps
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-07.png	us earthly creatures to build an Altar
data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-08.png	for God to come nearer to God.
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-00.png	The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue,
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-01.png	which is written on two plates, the hard facts
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-02.png	of life, and all facts are &quot;one&quot;. We have all
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-03.png	come across human Shamirs and they leave
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-04.png	a deep impression on our feelings and senses.
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-05.png	They make us the Altar for God to emit
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-06.png	the Light which can be read in every
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-07.png	language. The Shamir is the &quot;seventh&quot; and
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-08.png	most important creature, that was created on
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-09.png	the eve of the Sabbath, to bring the
data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-10.png	Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-00.png	Then the whole earth will be His Altar. &quot;And it
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-01.png	shall come to pass, if 1ye shall 1hearken
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-02.png	diligently unto my commandments, which I command
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-03.png	you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-04.png	serve Him with all your heart and with all
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-05.png	your soul.&quot; This may seem very good, but there
data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-06.png	is something deficient.
data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-00.png	They will not work in union. If physical power, spiritual power
data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-01.png	and visionary power is not united, man will remain in his heart
data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-02.png	selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-03.png	gratify selfish aims, then each man will gather-in
data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-04.png	for himself only, instead of all to help to gather your
data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-05.png	corn, your wine and your oil.
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-00.png	Self-control gives us: Freedom to worship God. (3) Salt Water and Charauses:
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-01.png	the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-02.png	(MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew, Salt is the covenant of 1thy God,
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-03.png	Levit. 2, 13.) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-04.png	ourselves and have peace with one-another. And the sweet
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-05.png	Mortar (the CHARAUSES in Hebrew) that binds all the &quot;hard-
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-06.png	facts&quot; together and explains them, represents the Oral
data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-07.png	Tradition.
data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-00.png	We dip into both, at the Seder. And we want to understand
data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-01.png	more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition, our inheritance.
data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-02.png	Living the life of the Torah (&quot;dipping-in&quot;) makes us
data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-03.png	meek: &quot;But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-04.png	delight themselves in the abundance of Peace&quot; (Psalm 37,
data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-05.png	11). That gives us freedom from want.
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-00.png	Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-01.png	by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-02.png	that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable,
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-03.png	but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-04.png	that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-05.png	to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the
data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-06.png	other side as victors.
data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-00.png	Can we then frame some 'rules' which may enable us to live life
data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-01.png	as fully as possible, without having our energy sapped by un-
data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-02.png	necessary weariness. (a) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness.
data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-03.png	We have a saying 'My head will never save my feet'. Time
data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-04.png	after time we forget something and have to go back
data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-05.png	upstairs or down to the shops.
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-00.png	I would not want to either, but if she wants to get through
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-01.png	the day without becoming exhausted, she will be well advised to
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-02.png	sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-03.png	do, note the order in which they can most conveniently be
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-04.png	done (or must be done because of other predetermined factors
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-05.png	- you must, for example, do your shopping on the morning of
data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-06.png	the early closing day).
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-00.png	In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom.
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-01.png	Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-02.png	they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-03.png	in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-04.png	echo-sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-05.png	their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-06.png	gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-07.png	spawning herring are always found.
data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-00.png	(Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may
data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-01.png	be by actual contact, or by sight reaction to the disturbed
data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-02.png	sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations
data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-03.png	through or along the bottom.) But given such a bow
data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-04.png	wave of disturbance, it is obvious that without something
data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-05.png	to overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-00.png	Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word,
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-01.png	Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-02.png	are of the utmost importance to the worker.
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-03.png	It washes beautifully, never loses its colour
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-04.png	nor becomes 'stringy', is very elastic and
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-05.png	preserves the beauty of the design. It is easy
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-06.png	to work with, soft, glossy and of uniform
data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-07.png	thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread.
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-00.png	Remember that texture plays an important part in
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-01.png	the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-02.png	are more effective for the delicate designs used for
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-03.png	tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-04.png	the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-05.png	chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-06.png	are made of steel, composition or bone. Steel
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-07.png	crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0,
data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-08.png	the largest, to number 8, the smallest.
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-00.png	Note that squared lines marking
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-01.png	the top member of the toe are
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-02.png	needed as well as the upper ex-
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-03.png	tent of the taper, and in
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-04.png	this case it is necessary to
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-05.png	mark in the line of the taper
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-06.png	with pencil and straight-edge
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-07.png	as at (B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-08.png	made at the upper toe line
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-09.png	exactly down to the taper line,
data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-10.png	no farther.
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-00.png	This last point is certainly important because almost
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-01.png	everyone has come to recognise that machines
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-02.png	are not only an economic necessity, but that a
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-03.png	great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-04.png	installation of a power tool. As an elementary
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-05.png	example, surely no one can pretend to enjoy
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-06.png	ripping out parts from hardwood. Most men
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-07.png	would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-08.png	were available.
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-00.png	The amount of the backward tilt and
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-01.png	also the height is left to personal choice
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-02.png	and the width is best taken directly
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-03.png	from the work to ensure a good fit.
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-04.png	Fix the piece A to the sides first
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-05.png	with glue and panel pins and then fit
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-06.png	the frame together with the piece
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-07.png	B temporarily in place on the chair
data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-08.png	frame.
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-00.png	Decide on the required angle of slope,
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-01.png	keeping B flat on the chair seat, and mark
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-02.png	off the exact position of B on the side
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-03.png	pieces. These can then be cut at the correct
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-04.png	angle and B is glued and nailed in place.
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-05.png	A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-06.png	to the frame and its edges planed off
data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-07.png	flush.
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-00.png	The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-01.png	correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat.
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-02.png	Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-03.png	to allow for the chines to rest in these
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-04.png	notches, as they are not fastened to the
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-05.png	moulds, which will only be used whilst
data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-06.png	the hull is under construction.
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-00.png	Dr. Davidson said he would go for
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-01.png	a walk over the fields while we attended
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-02.png	to our business. To my amusement,
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-03.png	when we met at tea at the rectory
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-04.png	after the Dedication, the Archbishop
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-05.png	said he had been stopped by
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-06.png	a farmer in a field. He seemed
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-07.png	rather indignant, but we took the
data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-08.png	episode without a smile till afterwards.
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-00.png	Nevertheless, average net family income
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-01.png	was appreciably higher in families with
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-02.png	several children than in those with only,
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-03.png	many of which were incomplete families
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-04.png	of younger parents with lower earnings,
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-05.png	and of course with lower tax reliefs and
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-06.png	no family allowances. The rise in net family
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-07.png	incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-08.png	est for childless couples, especially older
data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-09.png	couples (probably because of the
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-00.png	'Are you enjoying yourself, Olimpia?' she
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-01.png	asked idly, tapping the girl's cheek lightly with
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-02.png	her fan, in passing; but she did not wait for
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-03.png	the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-04.png	was wondering whether Olimpia had been
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-05.png	watching her talk with Orsini. Surely she
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-06.png	could not have overheard anything they
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-07.png	said? A moment's reflection reassured her
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-08.png	on that point, for she was certain no one
data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-09.png	had been standing near them.
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-00.png	Having trimmed up the chines, we are now ready
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-01.png	to plank the sides. Start again at the bows,
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-02.png	clamping into position with a 'D' clamp. Bend
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-03.png	round the frame to the stern and clamp there. If
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-04.png	you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-05.png	well. After generously covering with glue, screw
data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-06.png	the sides to the transom framing and the chine.
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-00.png	Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws (brass) or nail
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-01.png	with inch and a quarter galvanized nails, if
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-02.png	you are doing it that way. Use flat head screws
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-03.png	about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-04.png	the 1/4 in. ply. Make a very small hole for
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-05.png	the screw to allow for a good grip. Remember
data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-06.png	to glue before screwing.
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-00.png	Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom,
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-01.png	which is cut in one piece. It should overlap just a
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-02.png	trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-03.png	screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-04.png	necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-05.png	the screws. I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-06.png	the bottom, both for screwing to the chines and
data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-07.png	the bottom shaped transom facing.
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-00.png	In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-01.png	of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-02.png	to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-03.png	for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. An
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-04.png	approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-05.png	tober, 1959, the first experimental day-release course for
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-06.png	men was organised. Eleven students from seven firms atten-
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-07.png	ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-08.png	to the men and their employers that the venture was an
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-09.png	experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-10.png	as the participants.
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-00.png	1. Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-01.png	and retirement according to the occupational
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-02.png	level of employees? 2. If so, which occupational
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-03.png	levels are the better or the poorer prepared
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-04.png	for successful adjustment to retirement and
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-05.png	in what aspects? 3. Does the evidence
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-06.png	obtained support a rationale for adapting
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-07.png	a pre-retirement planning and preparation
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-08.png	programme to the needs of older employees
data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-09.png	of different occupational levels?
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-00.png	Each time you rehearse you will probably put
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-01.png	things in a different way. All the better! - it will
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-02.png	sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-03.png	itself. Remember your four names - have the list
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-04.png	with you if you like - and you simply can't
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-05.png	be flummoxed! Of course, in any speech a good
data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-06.png	start and a good finish are half the battle.
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-00.png	The police began a systematic search of the line -
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-01.png	no easy task, but one in which patience and method
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-02.png	paid off. At a spot on the embankment between
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-03.png	Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-04.png	pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-05.png	sticking to it. The murder weapon, more than likely,
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-06.png	and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-07.png	killer to book in modern times.
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-00.png	But in 1897, alas! there was no fingerprint bureau,
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-01.png	no experts to check and photograph any 'dabs' it
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-02.png	might have yielded. It was a tough case to
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-03.png	tackle, and Superintendent Robinson, of the L.S.W.R.
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-04.png	Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of Scotland
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-05.png	Yard, combined forces in the investigation. While
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-06.png	accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-07.png	attacked for the sake of robbery, they did not
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-08.png	overlook the possibility that this might have
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-09.png	disguised another motive, and a thorough check
data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-10.png	of her former men friends and acquaintances began.
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-00.png	They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, so-
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-01.png	me well meant, some mischievous, including one that a
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-02.png	man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-03.png	the Thursday evening, with blood actually dripping from
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-04.png	his hands. The inquest was opened on February 17, but,
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-05.png	beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-06.png	the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-07.png	in which she had died, there was nothing on
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-08.png	which to proceed, and the inquest was
data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-09.png	adjourned.
data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-00.png	Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-01.png	trails. It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-02.png	money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for
data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-03.png	a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead
data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-04.png	woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-05.png	named Brown.
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-00.png	The truth is that good food offers a
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-01.png	programme of entertainment almost
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-02.png	unlimited in its variety and its presen-
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-03.png	tation affords an opportunity of
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-04.png	showing a guest something of ourselves.
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-05.png	It is a far enough cry from the primitive
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-06.png	meal-times of a simpler world to the
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-07.png	banquets of later days, when the table
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-08.png	groaned under its load of complicated
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-09.png	dishes, and for all the blossoming of the
data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-10.png	arts around them the diners were little
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-00.png	There was always the spice of an orgy
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-01.png	in those Roman feasts, for instance, with
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-02.png	all their peacocks and nightingales'
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-03.png	tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-04.png	elaborate fashion of eating brought
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-05.png	out of Italy into France, we are told,
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-06.png	by Catherine de Medici. The peasant in
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-07.png	those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-08.png	generously enough in his own fashion,
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-09.png	save at feast times, when he, too, let
data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-10.png	himself go; and it was from his simpler
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-00.png	Epicures and gourmands, sated by the
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-01.png	unending procession of dishes from those
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-02.png	mammoth kitchens of the 18th century -
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-03.png	that amazing epoch of grossness and
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-04.png	delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-05.png	the dishes of the country, and, instead
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-06.png	of gorging the eye with magnitude,
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-07.png	began to understand the value of
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-08.png	intelligent selection and comparative
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-09.png	simplicity, though nowadays their
data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-10.png	simplified meals would seem quite
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-00.png	Does one, however, know who first thought
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-01.png	of boiling water and food? The ancient
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-02.png	Britons, I believe, used to make water hot
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-03.png	by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-04.png	because their pots would not stand fire;
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-05.png	but Jacob must have had one that
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-06.png	would, because Esau sold his birthright
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-07.png	to him for a mess of pottage - and then
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-08.png	we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt
data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-09.png	after which the Israelites sighed.
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-00.png	Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-01.png	known any way of cooking meat
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-02.png	except by roasting and boiling. When
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-03.png	Achilles gave a royal feast the principal
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-04.png	dish was a grill, which he cooked himself,
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-05.png	and he knew how to do it, too: - When the
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-06.png	languid flames at length subside, He
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-07.png	throws a bed of glowing embers wide;
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-08.png	Above the coals the smoking fragment
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-09.png	turns, And sprinkles sacred salt
data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-10.png	from lifted urns.
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-00.png	When, however, the Greeks did learn the
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-01.png	art of making fireproof earthenware from
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-02.png	the Egyptians, their cookery made rapid
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-03.png	progress, because they were men of taste
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-04.png	and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-05.png	the banquets of the ancient world was the
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-06.png	fact that they did not confine the resources
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-07.png	of the table to the gratification of one
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-08.png	sense alone. Having exhausted their invention
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-09.png	in the preparation of stimulants for the
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-10.png	palate, they broke fresh ground and called
data/f07/f07-028b/f07-028b-11.png	another sense to their aid.
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-00.png	By delicate application of odours and richly-
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-01.png	distilled perfumes, these refined voluptuaries
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-02.png	aroused the fainting appetite and added a
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-03.png	more exquisite and ethereal enjoyment to
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-04.png	the grosser pleasures of the board. The grati-
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-05.png	fication of the sense of smelling was a
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-06.png	subject of no little importance to the Romans.
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-07.png	They considered flowers as forming a very
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-08.png	essential article in their festal preparations;
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-09.png	and it is the opinion of Bassius that
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-10.png	at their desserts the number of flowers
data/f07/f07-032b/f07-032b-11.png	far exceeded the number of fruits.
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-00.png	When Nero supped in # his Golden House,
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-01.png	a mingled shower of flowers and odorous
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-02.png	essences fell upon him; and one of the
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-03.png	recreations of Heliogabalus was to
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-04.png	smother his courtiers with flowers. Nor was
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-05.png	it entirely as an object of luxury that the
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-06.png	ancients made use of flowers; they were
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-07.png	considered to possess sanative and
data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-08.png	medicinal qualities.
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-00.png	According to Pliny, and others, certain
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-01.png	herbs and flowers proved of sovereign
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-02.png	power in preventing the approaches of
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-03.png	ebriety, or, as Bassius less clearly
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-04.png	expresses it, in clarifying the functions
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-05.png	of the brain. It is said that there is
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-06.png	nothing new under the sun, but regarding
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-07.png	foodstuffs the traveller occasionally
data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-08.png	encounters a certain measure of novelty.
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-00.png	In China, for instance, dried rats are
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-01.png	esteemed a delicacy. The visitor is told
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-02.png	that they restore the hair of the bald
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-03.png	and that a stewed black rat will ward
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-04.png	off a fever. A number of newly-born
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-05.png	white mice served alive, dipped in treacle
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-06.png	and swallowed like a prairie oyster is
data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-07.png	considered a piece of resistance.
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-00.png	But this time there was a very interesting
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-01.png	attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-02.png	payments demanded. The definition of an
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-03.png	adult was altered to read 'over sixteen',
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-04.png	and, where the poorest were to pay a groat,
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-05.png	the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-06.png	of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks,
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-07.png	and between these two extremes a graduated
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-08.png	scale of payments was fixed for the
data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-09.png	different classes of laymen and clerics.
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-00.png	Again the resentment was widespread and
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-01.png	the results disappointing - a tax estimated
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-02.png	to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000.
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-03.png	In the following year, 1380, the last and
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-04.png	most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-05.png	by a Parliament which met at Northampton.
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-06.png	There were dark reasons for a meeting so
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-07.png	far away from the capital in a town with
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-08.png	poor communications and not over supplied
data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-09.png	with hostelries and lodgings.
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-00.png	London was again in turmoil; but this time
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-01.png	over a question of trade rivalry. A rich mer-
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-02.png	chant from Genoa had been murdered, and
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-03.png	John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was one of
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-04.png	those charged with the crime. It is clear
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-05.png	from the chronicles that this was a sordid
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-06.png	quarrel between monopolists and interlopers.
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-07.png	The city merchants were jealous of foreign
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-08.png	merchants who could tempt court and
data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-09.png	baronage with rarer luxuries than those
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-00.png	Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-01.png	arithmetic which argued that, as the first
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-02.png	poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-03.png	three times the rate would produce 66,000.
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-04.png	The only concession made in view of the
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-05.png	objections to the first two poll-taxes was
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-06.png	the suggestion that the rich should help
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-07.png	the poor - but this was only a pious hope
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-08.png	because no machinery was provided for
data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-09.png	carrying it into effect, and a subordinate
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-00.png	Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-01.png	ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-02.png	the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-03.png	of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-04.png	thus synchronous with cardiac systole but,
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-05.png	when movement of blood through arteries is
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-06.png	hindered by compression, infarction or inter-
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-07.png	ception, the more distal arteries pulsate
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-08.png	less because their pulse is nothing other
data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-09.png	than the impulse of the blood entering them.
data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-00.png	When eventually the ovens were fixed at the new shop, the tremen-
data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-01.png	dously hard work was if anything intensified. George used to
data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-02.png	mix 100 stone of bread in 12 hours, and Kate served in the
data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-03.png	shop, which was open from 8 o'clock in the morning to
data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-04.png	12 o'clock at night. At that time pastries and buns
data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-05.png	were sold at 32 pieces for one shilling.
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-00.png	As they became known the Choir went to working-
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-01.png	men's clubs, to Conisborough on cheap trips to
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-02.png	sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-03.png	as the Bakers' Union, for whom they went on Satur-
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-04.png	day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-05.png	the members. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-06.png	on West Street, where a successful Sunday
data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-07.png	school was held.
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-00.png	After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-01.png	Germany for ten years, by which time in
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-02.png	1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey.
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-03.png	Towards the end of my five and a half years'
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-04.png	incumbency I was asked if I would start
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-05.png	a village choral society and conduct it.
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-06.png	This opened up a new interest, and we plunged
data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-07.png	into it.
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-00.png	The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-01.png	Lansdowne Road district, but I needed more help in the
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-02.png	church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays.
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-03.png	Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-04.png	1913 soon after I had come, and he organized the Mission
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-05.png	district and got to know, and be known by, many of
data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-06.png	the people of the parish.
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-00.png	A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-01.png	year, 1914, when war broke out. Very soon Chaplains for
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-02.png	the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-03.png	that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-04.png	not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-05.png	for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-06.png	than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-07.png	was very soon in France where he did splendid
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-08.png	work until his health broke down and he had a bad
data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-09.png	attack of enteric fever.
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples. He
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-01.png	told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his health permitted
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-02.png	him to enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which is
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-03.png	a great resource. Vesuvius seems to be tired; he is going out
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-04.png	fast.... What a gay, lively people, and what a busy town. At
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-05.png	Rome, every other man was a priest: here the priest is 1superceded
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-06.png	by the soldier - a favourable change in my eye, particularly as
data/g06/g06-011f/g06-011f-07.png	the troops are very fine.'
data/g06/g06-018f/g06-018f-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl back to
data/g06/g06-018f/g06-018f-01.png	England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In late November, he
data/g06/g06-018f/g06-018f-02.png	was 'suffering as usual', but hoped, he told Arthur, 'to find this
data/g06/g06-018f/g06-018f-03.png	place agree with me better than Naples. The journey has been against
data/g06/g06-018f/g06-018f-04.png	me, as there has been much rain and damp, but the temperature
data/g06/g06-018f/g06-018f-05.png	is high & I have not yet thought of a fire....
data/g06/g06-026f/g06-026f-00.png	A pleasant life truly!... It so happens that I have an Italian
data/g06/g06-026f/g06-026f-01.png	who is perhaps the best Valet de Chambre that ever was. But he
data/g06/g06-026f/g06-026f-02.png	has not one word of English.' While he was writing this letter he
data/g06/g06-026f/g06-026f-03.png	heard of the fall of the Whigs, and the temporary assumption
data/g06/g06-026f/g06-026f-04.png	of the government by the Duke of Wellington.
data/g06/g06-031f/g06-031f-00.png	'What a frightful event!' he wrote. 'I tremble! What infatuation!
data/g06/g06-031f/g06-031f-01.png	Personally I am indifferent, but I really tremble for my country! I may
data/g06/g06-031f/g06-031f-02.png	be mistaken, 1tho' I cannot but fear that the exasperation of the
data/g06/g06-031f/g06-031f-03.png	People will be so great at the return of Ultratoryism, that the
data/g06/g06-031f/g06-031f-04.png	Commons House upon a dissolution, which must be had, will be
data/g06/g06-031f/g06-031f-05.png	a mass of Radicalism, &amp; then God knows what may happen....
data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-00.png	God grant, however, that I may be a false prophet &amp; that all
data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-01.png	may go well. Sir R. Peel was here, I understand, but an express

data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-03.png	While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter in the
data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-04.png	history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an effective alleviation of
data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-05.png	his painful malady. None of the numerous conventional remedies to
data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-06.png	which he had been subjected ever since the symptoms had first
data/g06/g06-037f/g06-037f-07.png	shown themselves seventeen years before had had the slightest effect.
data/g06/g06-042f/g06-042f-00.png	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today, in the 1960s,
data/g06/g06-042f/g06-042f-01.png	no cure has been found for the 6tic douloureux. As early as

data/g06/g06-042f/g06-042f-03.png	the new German curative method known as homoeopathy had been
data/g06/g06-042f/g06-042f-04.png	brought to his notice.
data/g06/g06-045f/g06-045f-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law, the
data/g06/g06-045f/g06-045f-01.png	diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to advise Anglesey to give the
data/g06/g06-045f/g06-045f-02.png	system a trial, adding that it was being cultivated with extraordinary
data/g06/g06-045f/g06-045f-03.png	success in France and Italy, and that he himself was being treated
data/g06/g06-045f/g06-045f-04.png	under a doctor who had studied under its founder, the aged Dr.
data/g06/g06-045f/g06-045f-05.png	Samuel Hahnemann.
data/g06/g06-047f/g06-047f-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis Burdett described

data/g06/g06-047f/g06-047f-02.png	than a human being', had an increasing number of disciples among
data/g06/g06-047f/g06-047f-03.png	unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe. One of these was
data/g06/g06-047f/g06-047f-04.png	the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey consulted in
data/g06/g06-047f/g06-047f-05.png	May 1834.

data/g06/g06-050f/g06-050f-05.png	persevering, 'but he appears to despair of ever being cured.'
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples.
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-01.png	He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-02.png	health permitted him to enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-03.png	wrote, 'is arrived, which is a great resource. Vesuvius
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-04.png	seems to be tired; he is going out fast.... What a gay,
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-05.png	lively people, and what a busy town. At Rome, every other
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-06.png	man was a priest: here the priest is 1superceded by
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-07.png	the soldier - a favourable change in my eye, particularly
data/g06/g06-011i/g06-011i-08.png	as the troops are very fine.'
data/g06/g06-018i/g06-018i-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl back to
data/g06/g06-018i/g06-018i-01.png	England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In late
data/g06/g06-018i/g06-018i-02.png	November, he was 'suffering as usual', but hoped, he
data/g06/g06-018i/g06-018i-03.png	told Arthur, 'to find this place agree with me better than

data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-08.png	consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-01.png	revered master at Ko"then, near Leipzig, asking
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-02.png	for advice. In doing so he described his
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-03.png	distinguished patient and his symptoms. He
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-04.png	told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-05.png	strong, energetic man with a gentle and
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-06.png	charming character, even-tempered and
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-07.png	sedate, not easily irritated, patient and
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-08.png	persevering, 'but he appears to despair
data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-09.png	of ever being cured.'
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-00.png	I have taken an exact inventory of them.'
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-01.png	Thus on April 21st, several days before
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-02.png	Trelawny appeared, Gamba wrote to Lord
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-03.png	Sidney Osborne, and his inventory has been
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-04.png	preserved. The papers were reopened in the
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-05.png	presence of leading Missolonghi officials
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-06.png	in order to make sure that no recent will
data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-07.png	was amongst them.
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-00.png	It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-01.png	his copying. Considering that Pietro was not above
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-02.png	twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-03.png	of heavy responsibilities, his conduct reveals him as
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-04.png	one of the most intelligent as well as the most
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-05.png	sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece. With
data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-06.png	his good looks - for he 'carried the passport of a very

data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-09.png	Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how

data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-00.png	Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed,
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-01.png	and wrote to Lady Byron after she had
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-02.png	received a visit from him: I have today seen
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-03.png	Count Gamba - which was very distressing
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-04.png	for many reasons but quite unavoidable - he
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-05.png	is a pleasing, fine looking young man &amp;
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-06.png	spoke with great feeling. The unfortunate
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-07.png	Augusta was in one of her worst states of
data/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-08.png	confusion.
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-00.png	She had loved Byron, but she had
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-01.png	betrayed him, betrayed him not twice, as
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-02.png	he had betrayed her, but again and again
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-03.png	over a long span of time, fawning on his
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-04.png	implacable wife, purveying to her in secret
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-05.png	the unguarded letters he never suspected
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-06.png	any eye but her own would see, feeding
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-07.png	the stealthy fires of her animosity: and
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-08.png	having betrayed him, she had grown to fear
data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-09.png	and almost to hate him.
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-00.png	She had dreaded his outpourings of affection
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-01.png	for her in poetry that he thought would clear
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-02.png	her and that only compromised her, and the
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-03.png	headstrong folly that tempted him to write on
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-04.png	ever more daring themes, teaching the world
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-05.png	to guess what repentance and unrepentance
data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-06.png	preyed upon his thoughts.
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-00.png	The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-01.png	we were invited to review, were to advise on: (a) the
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-02.png	circumstances, if any, in which the supply of morphine
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-03.png	and heroin, and preparations containing these substances,
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-04.png	to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-05.png	as medically advisable; (b) the precautions which medical
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-06.png	practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-07.png	heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-08.png	administrative measures that seemed expedient to
data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-09.png	secure observance of those precautions.
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-00.png	All types of household benefited from the improved
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-01.png	supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-02.png	with 1958, but the increase in consumption was
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-03.png	least in families containing children. 77. Total
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-04.png	bread consumption was virtually unchanged,
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-05.png	although most types of household bought less
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-06.png	white bread and more rolls and speciality
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-07.png	breads than in 1958. Most groups increased
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-08.png	their purchases of puddings, cakes and biscuits,
data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-09.png	but obtained less flour.

data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-01.png	different commodities attributable to the adult
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-02.png	couple and each additional child in a selected
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-03.png	group of households consisting of childless couples
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-04.png	(both under 55) and couples with different numbers
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-05.png	of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-06.png	the Annual Report for 1956. The younger childless
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-07.png	couples are broadly comparable in age and family
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-08.png	income with the family households, so that differences
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-09.png	in food expenditure may be associated with the
data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-10.png	presence of children.
data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-00.png	The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956,
data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-01.png	but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-02.png	milk was reduced; since 1957 it has again declined. Most of the
data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-03.png	average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods,
data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-04.png	potatoes and milk; for fresh green vegetables, fruit, cheese, fish and
data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-05.png	carcase meat, the incremental expenditure was slight.
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-00.png	79. Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-01.png	the diets of households of different composition. The averages
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-02.png	showed little change compared with those for the previous year,
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-03.png	except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D.
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-04.png	Since physiological requirements vary widely with age, sex
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-05.png	and level of activity, comparisons between families of different
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-06.png	composition are only apposite when considered in relation
data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-07.png	to needs.
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-00.png	The development corporations have provided office
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-01.png	accommodation (in addition to that included in
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-02.png	factory premises) in the form of buildings specially
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-03.png	designed to meet the needs of particular organisations,
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-04.png	and have also erected some buildings as a

data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-06.png	have readily let on satisfactory terms, including
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-07.png	in many cases a break clause in the lease allowing
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-08.png	for a future increase in rent to reflect rising
data/h07/h07-060b/h07-060b-09.png	values in the town.
data/h07/h07-063b/h07-063b-00.png	More modest premises are provided on the upper
data/h07/h07-063b/h07-063b-01.png	floors over shops in some of the town centres for
data/h07/h07-063b/h07-063b-02.png	the small type of office organisation. Government

data/h07/h07-066b/h07-066b-07.png	national average.
data/h07/h07-069a/h07-069a-00.png	But whereas the national annual average will settle
data/h07/h07-069a/h07-069a-01.png	down at something like 1.4 per cent after the
data/h07/h07-069a/h07-069a-02.png	&quot;bulge&quot; has passed, in the new towns the percentage
data/h07/h07-069a/h07-069a-03.png	will generally go on rising (in some towns into the
data/h07/h07-069a/h07-069a-04.png	middle seventies) reaching levels of perhaps 2.3
data/h07/h07-069a/h07-069a-05.png	per cent in some towns before it begins to decline.

data/h07/h07-071a/h07-071a-02.png	relatively few retirements. For the most part therefore
data/h07/h07-071a/h07-071a-03.png	local employment can be provided only by the
data/h07/h07-071a/h07-071a-04.png	expansion of existing industry and the introduction

data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-03.png	include: together with their lead parents.
data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-04.png	All but lead-212 will decay completely
data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-05.png	within six hours. The decay of lead-212
data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-06.png	will distort the observed activity for
data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-07.png	hour and a half days if it is
data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-08.png	present.
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-00.png	If anything, he had merely become a little more reserved, and
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-01.png	much more polite. I thought to myself: 'A few years in the
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-02.png	East, my boy, and you'll drink - I've seen your kind be-
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-03.png	fore!' After the curry, I wanted only to go upstairs to
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-04.png	bed. I had long since become accustomed, and now addicted,
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-05.png	to an after-curry nap.
data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-06.png	Verena Holenstein
data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-00.png	Lee, however, showed not the slightest sign of fatigue. 'I
data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-01.png	wonder if you'd mind if I took a bit of a look round,'
data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-02.png	he asked Nigel. 'I don't sleep in the afternoons.' Nigel,
data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-03.png	I must say, was very good about it. I knew how much
data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-04.png	he probably wanted to sleep himself. But, almost
data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-05.png	gallantly, he said:
data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-00.png	The Prime Minister looked puzzled, and said, 'Julia Drayford? How
data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-01.png	does she come into it? I can't follow these complexities -' 'It isn't
data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-02.png	quite that. The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful
data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-03.png	indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence.
data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-04.png	I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who
data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-05.png	what.
data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-00.png	Knowing Nigel, I would have been surprised if he
data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-01.png	had not made his usual 'arrangements'. A bachelor
data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-02.png	himself, he knew well how to entertain his bachelor
data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-03.png	friends. He caught my look and pursed his lips in
data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-04.png	a quick little grimace of acknowledgement; then raised
data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-05.png	an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction.
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-00.png	After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-01.png	grandchildren who had sat, rather intimidated
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-02.png	by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-03.png	Gibbons carving around the fireplace, rose
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-04.png	gratefully from the table, leaving the two
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-05.png	men together. A nurse came in, and asked
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-06.png	the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-07.png	helped out on to the lawn, but he waved
data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-08.png	her away impatiently.
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-00.png	I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-01.png	hair of the Empress Messalina, as she crouched
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-02.png	in terror in the gardens of Lucullus, awaiting the
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-03.png	sword of the executioner.' 'Ah!' exclaimed
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-04.png	Farnese, with a snigger. 'The old cuckold
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-05.png	Claudius had the last word, after all. He
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-06.png	knew how to deal with an adulterous wife,
data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-07.png	eh, Orsini?'
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-00.png	If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-01.png	not hear it. Now they entered the long gallery
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-02.png	where they dispersed and wandered around, admiring
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-03.png	and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-04.png	splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-05.png	back from Lepanto. After a short interval, Orsini
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-06.png	found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria.
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-07.png	'We must talk further,' he said in a low
data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-08.png	urgent voice. 'Where?'
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-00.png	'In that case,' he reverted to French, 'I shall be obliged
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-01.png	to lift you from the coach.' Without answering him, she
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-02.png	rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly:
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-03.png	'No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here.' Ignoring his
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-04.png	proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle. 'Will you
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-05.png	be so good as to order your men not to molest my
data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-06.png	maid,' she said coldly to Orsini.
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-00.png	'She is absolutely safe,' he replied; but he turned,
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-01.png	nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-02.png	coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-03.png	instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her,
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-04.png	breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-05.png	away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-06.png	of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple
data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-07.png	were etched against the clear blue of the sky.
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-00.png	He did well. He got in touch with
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-01.png	the woman Pete was passing off as his
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-02.png	mother. Starmouth managed to
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-03.png	win her confidence. It seems that
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-04.png	she was an honest enough woman,
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-05.png	only her mind wasn't as clear as
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-06.png	it could have been. She showed
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-07.png	him photographs. He found out
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-08.png	that the name of her house - Grand
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-09.png	Greve - was taken from a bay
data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-10.png	in one of the Channel Islands.
data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-00.png	&quot;Another was the body fetching up on the mooring-hook - practically where
data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-01.png	it started from.&quot; &quot;And you finding out about the spy at the Marshams',
data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-02.png	&quot; Passon said. &quot;Just a stroke of luck, sir,&quot; Tong said. &quot;Luck or not,
data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-03.png	Harry, it was the real turning-point for us. Must be true what they
data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-04.png	say. 'Tong can't go wrong!' &quot;
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-00.png	Only the old man's room was too much for
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-01.png	her. Once she put her head round the door,
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-02.png	and Sam shouted: &quot;You get right out of
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-03.png	this, Rose. You leave me in peace.&quot;
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-04.png	Rose took one breath of the stagnant air.
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-05.png	&quot;You - you polecat!&quot; she screeched, and
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-06.png	retreated without argument. Her re*?
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-07.png	2gime, hated alike by all the men,
data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-08.png	produced one extraordinary result.
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-00.png	One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-01.png	about to enter the house. Fred grasped his brother's elbow.
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-02.png	&quot;Nick, I can't stomach this much longer.&quot; &quot;Nor me. What's the
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-03.png	answer? Mum's picking up, but she'll never be her old self
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-04.png	again.&quot;
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-05.png	&quot;That First Flower's driving me nuts,&quot; Fred said. &quot;I'm going to put
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-06.png	a stop to it.&quot;
data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-07.png	&quot;What with - arsenic?&quot;
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-00.png	Sam sank back on his pillow. &quot;Oh, my
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-01.png	God! All right, you win!&quot; With that settled
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-02.png	Fred was soon married. The First Flower
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-03.png	snatched up her infant and departed, mut-
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-04.png	tering sarcasms. The whole household
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-05.png	listened to the dwindling screams of the
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-06.png	baby with relief. Maggie soon proved her
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-07.png	worth, and after a time Dan summed up
data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-08.png	the general approval by saying:
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-00.png	Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-01.png	it beside the fire in the living-room, his thoughts once
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-02.png	more on Kitty. If she was really in love with Stevie
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-03.png	Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her, he
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-04.png	told himself moodily. Yet it was not as clear-cut as that.
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-05.png	He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-06.png	of the necessity to help and protect her, even against
data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-07.png	her will.
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-00.png	Tonight, for the first time, he had abandoned all
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-01.png	pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-02.png	for her. She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-03.png	him. In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-04.png	a bond between them. No doubt she had every intention
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-05.png	of keeping both of them on a string. On the whole he probably
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-06.png	had a slight advantage over the young man, inasmuch as he
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-07.png	had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-08.png	respect for the material things of life.
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-00.png	Stealing from cars is about the commonest
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-01.png	kind of crime in the book. There's nothing
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-02.png	that absolutely ties the missing money to the
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-03.png	circumstances of your father's death, that's
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-04.png	the point. Same with the passport. It's gone
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-05.png	and that's that. It may turn up in a dustbin
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-06.png	somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-07.png	far as the police are concerned there's nothing
data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-08.png	to go on.
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-00.png	In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-01.png	happened, but that's not good enough for them.
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-02.png	That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-03.png	that your father took his life, backed by
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-04.png	medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps.'
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-05.png	A little man with thin brown hair and a
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-06.png	ruddy complexion came over and greeted
data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-07.png	them.
data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-00.png	He wore a short white coat. Hugh ordered drinks.
data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-01.png	'I was sorry to read about your dad in the
data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-02.png	paper', the man said to Hugh in a thick
data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-03.png	voice which bore traces of a cockney accent.
data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-04.png	'I was telling your friend how he come
data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-05.png	in here the very night he passed away.'
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-00.png	Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar-
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-01.png	man whom Roddy had raked up. He was seedy and
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-02.png	middle-aged with small black eyes set close to-
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-03.png	gether beneath heavily marked brows and a sly,
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-04.png	crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence.
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-05.png	'He was hitting the bottle pretty hard, sir...' the
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-06.png	man said in a loud whisper. 'Meaning no offe-
data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-07.png	nce', he added, looking at Hugh.
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-00.png	Like Clive, he was enthusiastic about the
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-01.png	engine and decided, apparently on the strength
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-02.png	of its efficiency, that Sandpiper was fit to
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-03.png	live in. I was more than thankful for his help
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-04.png	when we had installed my things and the
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-05.png	boat began to move. The river was crowded
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-06.png	with flocks of sailing boats which
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-07.png	swirled round us like gulls and there
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-08.png	were two locks to negotiate, but Max
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-09.png	seemed to know exactly what to do
data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-10.png	and at the same time kept me supplied
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-00.png	"How on earth do you know all this?" I asked
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-01.png	him. "I used to play about in these things
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-02.png	when I was a kid. And then I acted as guide
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-03.png	on a river boat one summer, to keep myself
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-04.png	going between terms at college." It was
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-05.png	the first I had heard of it, but that's
data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-06.png	one of the things I like about Max.
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-00.png	He has done so many things that there
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-01.png	is always something new and exciting to
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-02.png	discover about him. "You're wonderful," I
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-03.png	said, meaning it. He pressed the tip of my
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-04.png	nose with one finger. "That makes two of us."
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-05.png	It was about eight o'clock in the evening
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-06.png	when we tied up almost exactly opposite
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-07.png	Hardy's garden and went up on to the
data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-08.png	roof of the cabin to see what we could see.
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-00.png	From this side, Rivermead was less forbidding;
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-01.png	it stood a long way back from the water
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-02.png	at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-03.png	flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-04.png	the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-05.png	ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria; it
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-06.png	was built across a narrow backwater
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-07.png	and there was a delicate iron staircase
data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-08.png	climbing the outer wall to a room above.
data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-00.png	"You won't see anyone tonight, it's too late," Max
data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-01.png	said and turned to go. "No - wait," I put out a
data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-02.png	hand to stop him. The sun was no longer shining
data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-03.png	and it was dark across there by the trees,
data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-04.png	but I thought I had seen something move.
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-00.png	There was utter imbecility in his blank face. Presently the
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-01.png	muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned and
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-02.png	shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-03.png	Heather. Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-04.png	trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects.
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-05.png	For several minutes they had been facing each other across
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-06.png	a low table, like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-07.png	each other through forced association.
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-00.png	&quot;The Thetans,&quot; he said, &quot;are presumably here to
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-01.png	take charge, as it were, of the minds of the
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-02.png	people - who are probably falling all over them-
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-03.png	selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-04.png	them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-05.png	know. Now, because of prior hypnosis we have es-
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-06.png	caped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we no
data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-07.png	longer have any immunity.
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-00.png	There is just a hope that we may uncover
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-01.png	some weakness, and find a way of fighting
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-02.png	back at them.&quot; Heather agreed, and suggested
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-03.png	that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-04.png	ting how the Thetan machinations had been
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-05.png	working out. It occurred to Steve that this may
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-06.png	not have been entirely an objective suggestion
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-07.png	on her part; but he thought it a good idea
data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-08.png	nevertheless.
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-00.png	&quot;Now, to summarize what I think our
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-01.png	course of action should be. First, to avoid the
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-02.png	Thetans like the plague, for they must not
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-03.png	find us out! Second, to tread pretty warily
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-04.png	among our own people, finding out just how
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-05.png	much freedom we can take with safety.
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-06.png	And third, to study these damned Thetans.
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-07.png	We must learn all we can about
data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-08.png	them.
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-00.png	They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-01.png	he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street.
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-02.png	But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-03.png	the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-04.png	been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies.
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-05.png	First, it was Sunday morning; and, second, everyone
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-06.png	walked, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of
data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-07.png	a single all-exclusive purpose.
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-00.png	They had been married for six years, but the
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-01.png	salary raise, on the expectation of which they
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-02.png	had done so, had not materialised. &quot;Do you
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-03.png	know, I had to send back our bedroom
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-04.png	furniture in the second year,&quot; she moaned. She
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-05.png	had contacts in political circles, a school-
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-06.png	friend of hers having married Lester Peron,
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-07.png	a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-08.png	(literally) all-powerful Rocket Release
data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-09.png	Board.

data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-00.png	All Aristotle was excited at the time, not by the prospect of the
data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-01.png	U.S. President's visit, but by a great storm in the photo-
data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-02.png	sphere of the sun. A matter which on Earth would hardly
data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-03.png	penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-04.png	interest to the Mos, doubtless because their habitat is
data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-05.png	not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere.

data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-05.png	at the same time a door banged - "but don't
data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-06.png	say a word about it, Lester wants his
data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-07.png	mouth-organ to be forgotten now. The time
data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-08.png	has come for him to be taken seriously
data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-09.png	as a statesman."
data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-00.png	So once again the metaphysics were depressing,
data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-01.png	and in absolute contrast to the physical display.
data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-02.png	Mos have an un-American love of parades, and
data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-03.png	these young ones, on parade for jobs which they
data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-04.png	had to get to pay off their college bills, were naturally
data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-05.png	putting their best foot forward.
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-00.png	But the jet aircraft was already miles away,
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-01.png	swinging down to the darkening earth. &quot;It
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-02.png	passed me at fifty thousand feet, sir. It was
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-03.png	climbing steadily.&quot; Group Captain Llewelyn Jones, Officer
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-04.png	Commanding R.A.F. Station, Dinas, looked keenly at the
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-05.png	Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-06.png	office. &quot;And what did it look like, Broughtons? Some
data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-07.png	sort of rocket?&quot;
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-00.png	Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet.
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-01.png	&quot;Well, actually, sir, it looked like - like a bus.
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-02.png	A single-decker,&quot; he elaborated. Daggers, the
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-03.png	Group Captain looked. &quot;Broughtons,&quot; he said silkily.
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-04.png	&quot;Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-05.png	earth-bound creatures? Aeroplanes fly, Broughtons.
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-06.png	Buses crawl.&quot; Very pale, Broughtons was. But
data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-07.png	determined. &quot;It was a bus, sir.
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-00.png	They'd got the lights on. There were people inside.
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-01.png	Waving.&quot; Like gimlets, the Station Commander's eyes.
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-02.png	&quot;Did you see the indicator board?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;And
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-03.png	what did it say? Mystery Tour?&quot; Oh, very caustic, that
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-04.png	Group Captain. But Broughtons stood his ground. &quot;No,
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-05.png	sir. It said Llangrwl.&quot; Llewelyn Jones sat
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-06.png	back in his chair. &quot;I see. So you met a bus at
data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-07.png	fifty thousand feet.
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-00.png	All lit up. Full of people waving as you went past.&quot;
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-01.png	Suddenly he crouched forward. &quot;Broughtons, if I thought
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-02.png	there were anything in Queen's Regulations to cover this,
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-03.png	I'd have you court-martialled. But I know there
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-04.png	isn't,&quot; he ended sadly. &quot;I tried to read the
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-05.png	registration number, sir. But it was getting dark.&quot;
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-06.png	He waited. But his commanding officer appeared to
data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-07.png	have forgotten him.
data/m04/m04-251/m04-251-00.png	&quot;Then we are saved,&quot; cried the Rev. Edwards.
data/m04/m04-251/m04-251-01.png	Shyly, Morfydd Owen produced a block of
data/m04/m04-251/m04-251-02.png	chocolate.
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-00.png	Though your wings and your scars are new,
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-01.png	you may join us.' 'I am Lily-yo. We three
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-02.png	are humans. You are only flymen. We will
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-03.png	not join you.' The Captives grunted in boredom.
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-04.png	The Chief Captive spoke again. 'Always this
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-05.png	talk from you of the Heavy World! You have
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-06.png	joined us. You are flymen, we are human. You
data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-07.png	know little, we know much.'
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-00.png	I saw several men running down towards
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-01.png	the shack. They were all armed with rifles.
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-02.png	As the nearest of them came round the
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-03.png	shack, his rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-04.png	Dowd, still wearing his blue check shirt. He
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-05.png	came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. &quot;We've
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-06.png	come 2a-calling,&quot; I said. &quot;Can't see no reason
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-07.png	for calling,&quot; he said. &quot;Still long as you're here
data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-08.png	you may as well stay a while.
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-00.png	'Light an' come on in.&quot; We dismounted and
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-01.png	one of the miners who'd come along with
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-02.png	Nick Dowd took our horses off to water.
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-03.png	We followed Nick Dowd into the shack.
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-04.png	They'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-05.png	a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-06.png	miners followed in at our heels. Nick Dowd
data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-07.png	found us a couple of boxes to sit on.
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-00.png	A small man in bib overalls and a battered
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-01.png	Derby hat fussed around the stove. &quot;2Ain't
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-02.png	exactly the Ritz Hotel but we've got our little
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-03.png	comforts,&quot; said Dowd. He introduced the men
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-04.png	who'd come in as Roper Smith, Shorty, Mick
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-05.png	Golightly, Swede and the Sodbuster. This last was
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-06.png	the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-07.png	had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-08.png	sweetened with molasses for all and for us
data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-09.png	there were two plates of beans.
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-00.png	&quot;They gives you the wind,&quot; said the Sodbuster
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-01.png	handing them to us, &quot;but it's all we got
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-02.png	as of now, apart from a few sacks of gold
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-03.png	dust.&quot; He winked at his partners. They all
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-04.png	watched us as we ate the beans. Then when
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-05.png	we'd finished and I'd rolled a cigarette
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-06.png	the man called Shorty said, &quot;You were saying when
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-07.png	you came in that 2somep'n happened last
data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-08.png	night.&quot;
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-00.png	&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;Something happened all right.
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-01.png	After you'd left the meeting, mister&quot; - I
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-02.png	looked across at Nick Dowd - &quot;someone cut
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-03.png	down William Appleton outside the Palace
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-04.png	with a shotgun.&quot; I paused and watched my
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-05.png	words affect them in their different ways.
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-06.png	&quot;That's sure bad news,&quot; said Dowd, sombrely.
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-07.png	&quot;It 2jest about leaves everything wide open
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-08.png	for Mr. Pell and his bunch,&quot; observed
data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-09.png	Shorty.
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-00.png	The rest of the men there said nothing but
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-01.png	you could see they were hard hit. They were
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-02.png	simple men who knew a lot maybe about
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-03.png	digging for gold but were babes in arms
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-04.png	when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-05.png	desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-06.png	rest. &quot;I guess we'd better hold onto the gold
data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-07.png	right 2hyar, Nick,&quot; said the Sodbuster.
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-00.png	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Dowd dubiously. &quot;2Mebbe we'd
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-01.png	better.&quot; Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-02.png	that point. &quot;If you do,&quot; he said, &quot;you'll be
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-03.png	sure asking for trouble. They'll be on your
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-04.png	necks before you can say 'knife'. It wouldn't
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-05.png	be the first time they've held up a diggings
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-06.png	at gun point either. They've done it before
data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-07.png	and got away with it.&quot;
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-00.png	"You're 2durned tootin', mister," said the man
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-01.png	called Roper Smith. "We've got five rifles among
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-02.png	us and a few six-shooters. But most of us
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-03.png	2ain't 2eddicated in shootin'. It'd be a
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-04.png	2massacree, 2yessir." "If you'll take a chance
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-05.png	on getting your gold to the bank, then we'll
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-06.png	abide by what we said at the meeting,"
data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-07.png	said Dan. "We'll watch the stage out of reach."
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-00.png	I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-01.png	with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-02.png	on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-03.png	handsome offer so I chimed in too. &quot;That
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-04.png	goes for me, gentlemen,&quot; I said. &quot;If they do try
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-05.png	and hold up the stage, it'll be a couple or
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-06.png	three of them, no more. I reckon we can deal
data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-07.png	with them all right.&quot;
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-00.png	&quot;Oh, the Press,&quot; said Seaweed. &quot;Down here on business, Mr.
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-01.png	Bawley?&quot; &quot;A pressman is always on the job.&quot;
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-02.png	He held out his hand and John could not do
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-03.png	otherwise than take it. &quot;Pleased to meet you,
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-04.png	Commander,&quot; he said. &quot;Now what about that
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-05.png	drink?&quot; John nodded - he could afford to buy
data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-06.png	one in return and he was lonely.
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-00.png	&quot;For the sake of accuracy,&quot; he said, &quot;and I
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-01.png	know how you newspaper people value that commodity! -
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-02.png	please don't address me as Commander. I'm
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-03.png	a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-04.png	drop the rank - such a mouthful!&quot; &quot;You're
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-05.png	absolutely right,&quot; said Bawley, as he pushed over
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-06.png	his glass. &quot;Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-07.png	all else. We pride ourselves about accuracy on
data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-08.png	the Courier.
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-00.png	Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service?
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-01.png	Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth.
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-02.png	Somewhat embarrassing, what?&quot; &quot;How can the
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-03.png	truth be embarrassing?&quot; John sipped his double
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-04.png	gin with relish. It was his favourite brand,
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-05.png	he was on the verge of a new chapter in
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-06.png	his career, and his companion's attitude was
data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-07.png	challenging.
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-00.png	Life at home and in Bath had been a
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-01.png	trifle too comfortable and humdrum.
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-02.png	He'd never before met a pressman and
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-03.png	found him curiously stimulating. "You're a
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-04.png	bit of a humorist, aren't you?" said
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-05.png	Bawley. "The truth is usually very embarra-
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-06.png	ssing. You're in submarines, aren't you?"
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-07.png	"You know a great deal about me,"
data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-08.png	said John.
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-00.png	"It's my business. I'll tell you more. You're
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-01.png	going to take over command of Pericles. Am I
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-02.png	right?" "Who told you?" "Little bird.
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-03.png	Other half?" John nodded. "On me." Bawley
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-04.png	shook his head. "All paid for by His Lordship,"
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-05.png	he said. "Expense account. You're a married
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-06.png	man with a couple of kids. Can't go wasting
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-07.png	your substance on a complete stranger. Set
data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-08.png	'em up, darling!"
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-00.png	His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-01.png	taste but it was unkind beyond words. She fumbled
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-02.png	with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-03.png	not wanting to smoke but needing some action
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-04.png	to help her control her feelings. &quot;Come and
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-05.png	dance,&quot; Doc's cheery voice came as a
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-06.png	lifeline and Gay got up quickly, mana-
data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-07.png	ging a smile.
data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-00.png	Hell.&quot; Doc answered for her. &quot;Just Hell. Never able to
data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-01.png	trust him out of your sight and having to put on
data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-02.png	a brave face and pretend that you don't mind
data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-03.png	whenever he flirts with another woman. He will
data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-04.png	you know, always, and you aren't the type
data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-05.png	who is tough enough to change him.&quot;
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-00.png	&quot;If I were somebody else's girl that's
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-01.png	what you'd get,&quot; she flashed at him, and
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-02.png	so had left him, on her dignity and not
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-03.png	seeing the look of admiration and revelation
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-04.png	which had followed her slim young figure
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-05.png	out of his sight. &quot;Mine,&quot; Nigel Lester had
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-06.png	decided with a sigh of satisfaction, and
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-07.png	then regarded the ring which he retrieved
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-08.png	from his pocket. &quot;At a price,&quot; he concluded,
data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-09.png	with some bitterness.
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-00.png	It was locked. Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-01.png	when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-02.png	of wads of paper. 'Cor!' he muttered aloud, 'there's
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-03.png	five thousand at least.' He felt in his jacket pocket
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-04.png	and pulled out a key ring. In succession he tried
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-05.png	his own briefcase key, a suitcase key and a
data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-06.png	device designed to lock typewriters.
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-00.png	Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-01.png	inequity of Miss Cheesecake well-nigh bathing
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-02.png	in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-03.png	easy on the immersion heater. 'What is it,
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-04.png	Cecil? Don't you feel well?' his mother
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-05.png	asked solicitously. 'You do look tired.
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-06.png	Go and get yourself a drink.' 'Don't
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-07.png	fuss, mother! I'm quite well and no more
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-08.png	tired than usual, and we finished the gin
data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-09.png	last week, you know that.'
data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-00.png	Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-01.png	of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-02.png	who is nearly bald is no longer a baby. He started to
data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-03.png	climb the stairs, stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-04.png	the treads. 'And don't wipe the dirt off on the
data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-05.png	towel like you did yesterday.
data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-00.png	'But I'm NOT irritable!' He rushed down
data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-01.png	the stairs and, snatching the case, ran back
data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-02.png	upstairs with it. 'And I've NOT been
data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-03.png	extravagant.' &quot;Naughty!' she called
data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-04.png	after him. 'Mother knows her boy.
data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-05.png	Arnold Olner
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-00.png	Fortunately, however, the fashion for Victorian
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-01.png	architecture which Mr. John Betjeman had
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-02.png	started several decades before had caught on
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-03.png	at last and therefore saved the situation for
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-04.png	the affluent middle-class, who now had plenty
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-05.png	of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant in. All this
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-06.png	Serena discovered, and more, but in stages. For the
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-07.png	first thing she did was to make an offer
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-08.png	on a small pink terraced cottage, two beds,
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-09.png	two inter-comm. rec., mod. k. and b., sep. W.C.
data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-10.png	small back yard, newly dec., near shops and tube
