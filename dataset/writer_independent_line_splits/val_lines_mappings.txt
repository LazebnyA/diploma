data/a01/a01-011/a01-011-01.png	Party (280,000 members) and Mr. Harry Nkumbula's African
data/a01/a01-011/a01-011-02.png	National Congress (400,000) will meet in London today
data/a01/a01-011/a01-011-03.png	to discuss a common course of action. Sir Roy is
data/a01/a01-011/a01-011-04.png	violently opposed to Africans getting an elected majority
data/a01/a01-011/a01-011-05.png	in Northern Rhodesia, but the Colonial Secretary,
data/a01/a01-011/a01-011-06.png	Mr. Iain Macleod, is insisting on a policy of change.
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-00.png	Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation.
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-01.png	Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end meeting. But he told
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-02.png	M Ps yesterday: "I have no knowledge of secret negotiations."
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-03.png	He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-04.png	Government. But the final decision remained with the British
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-05.png	Government. Mr. James Callaghan, Labour's Colonial spokesman,
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-06.png	said Sir Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks by
data/a01/a01-030/a01-030-07.png	refusing to sit round the conference table.
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-00.png	MR. Macmillan has picked a strong &quot;brains trust&quot;
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-01.png	team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-02.png	And he has abandoned plans to visit President de
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-03.png	Gaulle this month to smooth the way. General
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-04.png	de Gaulle's official welcome last week
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-05.png	to Britain's moves towards the Six was
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-06.png	taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-07.png	but no more than that.
data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-00.png	The team is composed of experienced
data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-01.png	negotiators in several fields. Sir Pier-
data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-02.png	son Dixon has a wide reputation as
data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-03.png	a skilful backstage negotiator since

data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-07.png	tary at the Ministry of Agriculture,
data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-08.png	Food, and Fisheries. The Foreign Office
data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-09.png	is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-00.png	Other leading members are: Sir Henry Lintott from
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-01.png	the Commonwealth Relations Office, Sir William
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-02.png	Corell-Barnes (Colonial Office), Mr. G. R. Bell
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-03.png	(Treasury), and Mr. G. H. Andrew (Board of Trade).
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-04.png	They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-05.png	he goes to Brussels, headquarters of the Common
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-06.png	Market Commission, or wherever the Six decide
data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-07.png	negotiations should be held.
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-00.png	Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-01.png	meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville, French
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-02.png	Foreign Minister, and Mr. Heath. MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-03.png	a man with troubles enough back home - seems
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-04.png	fated to fly into trouble abroad. Last year it was
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-05.png	the riots in Istanbul, which enlivened the NATO
data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-06.png	Council meeting.
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-00.png	Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-01.png	Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-02.png	monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-03.png	first to be held in Africa. Only a few hours af-
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-04.png	ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-05.png	at Accra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-06.png	demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-07.png	Stores, the largest in town.
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-00.png	The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-01.png	that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-02.png	week. Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget,
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-03.png	including a compulsory savings scheme which the
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-04.png	Ghana Government introduced in July. Ghana's strong
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-05.png	man is not here to face the storm. President Nkrumah,
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-06.png	having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-07.png	in Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-08.png	Sea and no one here professes to know when he
data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-09.png	will return.
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-00.png	But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-01.png	not let him down. The strong arm of authority has
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-02.png	been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-03.png	to tell. Today's Ghanaian Times (motto: &quot;The welfare
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-04.png	of the people is the supreme law&quot;) reports: &quot;The
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-05.png	Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-06.png	tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers.&quot;
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-00.png	At 9.40 Mr. Edusei, Minister of Transport and pro-
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-01.png	bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team,
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-02.png	drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-03.png	demonstrators, most of them shopgirls in overalls.
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-04.png	&quot;If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock,&quot; he
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-05.png	told them, 'the police will act.' At five to ten
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-06.png	a posse of police arrived and in less than
data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-07.png	two minutes the crowd had gone.
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-00.png	It alleged: Phones were being tapped and
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-01.png	going out of action; Police were visiting
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-02.png	people &quot;on no pretext whatsoever, except
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-03.png	to pass the time of day&quot;; Supporters had
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-04.png	been warned - one that his connection
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-05.png	with the committee was going too far; another
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-06.png	that anti-apartheid agitation was
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-07.png	all right, but support for the committee
data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-08.png	was not.
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-00.png	They are required to show why they
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-01.png	should not be bound over for disturbing
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-02.png	the peace and for inciting a breach
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-03.png	of the peace. The summonses say they
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-04.png	are &quot;likely to persevere in such unlawful
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-05.png	conduct.&quot; Lord Russell, 89, was
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-06.png	putting his affairs in order, and
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-07.png	packing a case, at his Chelsea home
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-08.png	yesterday. His secretary, American-born
data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-09.png	Mr. Ralph Schoenman, said:
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-00.png	Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-01.png	longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-02.png	Kaunda. Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister,
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-03.png	said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-04.png	Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-05.png	National Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-06.png	until he was outlawed in 1959. The record
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-07.png	of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-08.png	back a long way, Sir Roy told the
data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-09.png	Federal Parliament in Salisbury.
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-00.png	Two emissaries from the Laotian Government
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-01.png	of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-02.png	Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to invite Prince
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-03.png	Souvanna Phouma, the former Prime Min-
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-04.png	ister, to return to Laos. No details of
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-05.png	their mission have been disclosed, but it
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-06.png	was reported earlier in Laos that Prince
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-07.png	Boun Oum was considering asking
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-08.png	Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-09.png	Government.
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-00.png	All four were Conservative strongholds. Last September
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-01.png	a public poll showed that for the first time since
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-02.png	the Administration came to power in 1957 the
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-03.png	Liberals were ahead (43 per cent were in favour
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-04.png	of &quot;The Grits&quot; if a federal election had been
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-05.png	held last autumn, 38 per cent for the
data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-06.png	Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F.).
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-00.png	Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-01.png	unilateralists was not possible, though
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-02.png	he respected their views. He saw by reports
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-03.png	that &quot;those who organise these things&quot; were
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-04.png	recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-05.png	disarmament to shift the emphasis of
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-06.png	their intervention away from straight opposition
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-07.png	to the official document on to opposition
data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-08.png	to the Polaris base.
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-00.png	To Mr. Macmillan, Mr Gaitskell said the
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-01.png	Prime Minister should begin to take
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-02.png	seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-03.png	weapons within the Nato alliance. &quot;Let us say
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-04.png	to Macmillan that he should press, I hope
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-05.png	with the agreement of Kennedy, in
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-06.png	talks with the Soviet Union, for the establishment
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-07.png	in central Europe of a zone of controlled
data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-08.png	disarmament.&quot;
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-00.png	He thought, he said, that the Soviet
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-01.png	Union would be prepared to reach
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-02.png	an agreement on a zone of controlled
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-03.png	disarmament in Europe. Mr Gaitskell
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-04.png	concluded, declaring that the present
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-05.png	was the beginning of a great period of
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-06.png	opportunity for the party. It was a
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-07.png	great chance that should be grasped.
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-08.png	Inter-union jealousies prevent the
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-09.png	fulfilment of a common policy for wages
data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-10.png	and other major questions, Mr. Jack Cooper
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-00.png	There are three kinds of reasons that justify
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-01.png	the protests and these should carry weight with
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-02.png	the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. &quot;The
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-03.png	first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-04.png	serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-05.png	U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-06.png	circles, but in public opinion.&quot; Earl Russell
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-07.png	says it is inevitable, though profoundly
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-08.png	regrettable, that the agitation against
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-09.png	the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-10.png	to the policy of the United States.
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-00.png	The second reason is concerned with doubts
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-01.png	as to the safety of the people of Great Britain;
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-02.png	&quot;in the time of crisis it would probably be
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-03.png	impossible for the British authorities to
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-04.png	exercise any degree of control over the action
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-05.png	of Polaris submarines.&quot; He argues that
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-06.png	there is a distinct possibility that so long
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-07.png	as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-08.png	Soviet Union might retaliate against
data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-09.png	Britain alone.
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-00.png	&quot;Such retaliation might, and probably would,
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-01.png	destroy the whole population of Britain in
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-02.png	the course of, at the most, an hour&quot; without
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-03.png	provoking American retaliation. Earl Russell
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-04.png	believes: &quot;It is very questionable whether
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-05.png	British membership of Nato and British
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-06.png	permission of American bases on our territory
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-07.png	add anything to the strength of America,
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-08.png	while, on the contrary, they impose upon
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-09.png	America an onerous obligation which it
data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-10.png	may prove impossible to fulfil.&quot;
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-00.png	The third reason is that the supreme
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-01.png	interest for the whole world - East and
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-02.png	West and uncommitted nations - is the
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-03.png	prevention of nuclear war. &quot;A rapidly
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-04.png	growing body of opinion in this country
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-05.png	believes that Britain could be more effective
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-06.png	in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-07.png	by helping to suggest agreements which could
data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-08.png	be accepted by both East and West.&quot;
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-00.png	MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-01.png	to catch speculators in shares and property.
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-02.png	The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-03.png	public opinion over his "July Budget" came
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-04.png	dramatically in the Commons yesterday. Mr
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-05.png	Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-06.png	to deal in his next regular Budget with
data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-07.png	some profits which now escape tax.
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-00.png	Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-01.png	to the Treasury, said yesterday that the

data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-03.png	He went on to describe the kind of
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-04.png	people the Chancellor hopes to tax. These
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-05.png	are people buying and selling shares within
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-06.png	a short period, those &quot;stagging&quot; on a new issue
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-07.png	and property dealers who form a chain of
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-08.png	companies and put one property deal through
data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-09.png	each.
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-00.png	There were loud cries of &quot;shame&quot; from
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-01.png	all parts of the Conservative side. Mr.
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-02.png	Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-03.png	down. A few minutes later, Mr. Fell got up
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-04.png	and left the chamber. He returned five
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-05.png	minutes later to stand just inside the
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-06.png	doorway looking more composed. In the
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-07.png	middle of the amazing scene, Mr. Macmillan
data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-08.png	waved his hand at Mr. Fell.
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-00.png	Note circulation soared for the
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-01.png	sixth successive week - this
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-02.png	time by more than 15,000,000 # last
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-03.png	week. And that brought the figure
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-04.png	to a record 2,415,000,000. This was
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-05.png	100,000,000 more than the corresponding
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-06.png	week last year and 37,000,000 up on
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-07.png	the 1960 record set last Christmas.
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-08.png	Now look at the other side of all
data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-09.png	these coins.
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-00.png	Banks have paid in a first
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-01.png	instalment of almost 8,000,000
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-02.png	in response to the Budgette appeal.
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-03.png	About another 70,000,000 is due
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-04.png	by September 20. For nearly a year
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-05.png	about 150,000,000 has been frozen.
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-06.png	MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-07.png	German militarism in his replies to
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-08.png	the West on Berlin. And he repeats
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-09.png	that the problem &quot;must be solved
data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-10.png	this year.&quot;
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-00.png	The views of the Archbishop, who has
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-01.png	maintained an unflinching witness to what
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-02.png	Christianity really means, must carry weight. But
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-03.png	what, in fact, can the other Commonwealth countries
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-04.png	do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-05.png	minority? THERE is no evidence that the
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-06.png	policy of appeasement has modified the
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-07.png	actions of the Nationalists. On the contrary,
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-08.png	apartheid is being applied ever more
data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-09.png	ruthlessly.
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-00.png	The shock of expulsion from the
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-01.png	Commonwealth now seems to be the only
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-02.png	way left to try to bring home to the people of
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-03.png	South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-04.png	to disaster. It may be that the Commonwealth
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-05.png	Prime Ministers will decide against this final
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-06.png	step. If that is their decision they should also
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-07.png	go unequivocally on record that they regard
data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-08.png	apartheid as evil and indefensible.
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-00.png	Unless they do at least that, Dr. Verwoerd will
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-01.png	be able to return home claiming a triumph.
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-02.png	His smile will be blander than ever. WE are in
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-03.png	for it again: another Royal Wedding. Between
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-04.png	now and June, when the Duke of Kent will
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-05.png	marry Miss Worsley, hardly a day will pass
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-06.png	without a story or a picture or probably both,
data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-07.png	about the nuptial arrangements.
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-00.png	To be able to say &quot;New York next week&quot; is an
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-01.png	important advance. We must not be overconfident
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-02.png	that this # meeting will lead on to further
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-03.png	and decisive ones; but without it, we could not
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-04.png	look for them. Federal Germany votes tomorrow
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-05.png	and not a day too soon. There can seldom have
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-06.png	been an election campaign which more people
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-07.png	in and out of the country wanted to see over
data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-08.png	and done with.
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-00.png	To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-01.png	millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-02.png	efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-03.png	the Berlin crisis. It need not have been such a burden
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-04.png	if Western Governments had not been convinced
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-05.png	that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-06.png	Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor.
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-00.png	Last month West Germany was
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-01.png	reported to be halfway toward
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-02.png	this target. Her position as &quot;America's
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-03.png	principal Nato ally&quot; grows stronger
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-04.png	and stronger. Now this target which
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-05.png	Herr Strauss and his fellows
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-06.png	have their eyes on is control of the
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-07.png	warheads to these weapons. General
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-08.png	Heusinger, the man who caused
data/b06/b06-027/b06-027-09.png	a great disturbance last autumn
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-00.png	At last Brendan - to the journalist's
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-01.png	relief - turns his attention to
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-02.png	the writing scene. He proceeds to
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-03.png	place himself in the literary hierarchy.
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-04.png	&quot;I consider myself,&quot; he says, &quot;a cut
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-05.png	above Evelyn Waugh socially, a cut
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-06.png	above Nancy Mitford artistically, a
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-07.png	cut above Frank Haxell conversationally.
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-08.png	&quot;But,&quot; he continues, &quot;the greatest is
data/c06/c06-014/c06-014-09.png	Shelagh Delaney. Just because A Taste
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-00.png	THE Marriage-Go-Round (Carlton)
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-01.png	is also a comedy of manners,
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-02.png	but fun-films toting an X
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-03.png	certificate have to keep a sharp
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-04.png	look-out that the jokes about
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-05.png	sex (what else would they joke
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-06.png	about with an X?) are of the witty,
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-07.png	verbal variety and not the visual
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-08.png	slapstick. This has only one gag -
data/c06/c06-103/c06-103-09.png	that of the entry of a gladiator
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-00.png	The plain, sober manner of its
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-01.png	style all the more tellingly
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-02.png	points up not only the horror
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-03.png	of the case itself, which
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-04.png	floundered on to the electrocution
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-05.png	four years later of a German-
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-06.png	born Bronx carpenter named
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-07.png	Bruno Richard Hauptmann, but
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-08.png	to the raree-show emotionalism
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-09.png	and sensation-hunger of that
data/c06/c06-138/c06-138-10.png	era.
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-00.png	All this has been achieved through Nato under
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-01.png	American leadership. But a big role has been
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-02.png	played not only by the British Government but
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-03.png	by Right-Wing Labour in this country. They have
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-04.png	helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany,
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-05.png	in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-06.png	policy which brought disaster in 1939.
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-00.png	It would become easy to become cynical and
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-01.png	to despair. And yet, wherever the issues were put
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-02.png	clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-03.png	original stand. Only where the issues were
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-04.png	posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-05.png	were positions lost. It is my view that this
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-06.png	immediate confusion hides the fact that the
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-07.png	Peace movement is still advancing and that
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-08.png	clarification of the issues can bring a
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-09.png	majority to # secure the Scarborough
data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-10.png	decisions.
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-00.png	It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-01.png	ment to unite the movement as the Labour
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-02.png	leaders are not only in favour of American
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-03.png	bases, but are in favour of German bases and
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-04.png	troops being trained on British soil. The new
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-05.png	Defence statement, while accepting that Britain can-
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-06.png	not remain an independent nuclear Power, now
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-07.png	supports the policy of depending on American
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-08.png	nuclear weapons and the H-bomb, placing
data/b06/b06-079/b06-079-09.png	Britain in an even more dangerous position.
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-00.png	IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday. The streets
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-01.png	are tranquilly sunny and still, for the town
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-02.png	is at Mass. Most of it. In the front room of
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-03.png	a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-04.png	never actually got to church, but who are
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-05.png	gathered with devotion around Brendan Behan
data/c06/c06-000/c06-000-06.png	and a brandy bottle.
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-00.png	I'm the only man on earth who doesn't know
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-01.png	what his name is. Don't tell me. I want to
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-02.png	preserve that distinction. &quot;I already know about
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-03.png	Shepard and that Salvation Army chap Gagarin -
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-04.png	the two biggest bores since Cardinal Newman.
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-05.png	That's enough of all that hooey.&quot; HE plunges
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-06.png	on into reminiscences of his trips. There is
data/c06/c06-031/c06-031-07.png	much to recall.
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-00.png	For many years my union had to present its views
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-01.png	to the two major conferences of the movement and
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-02.png	take a licking. For us, unity meant accepting
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-03.png	unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-04.png	movement and having a go next time. Alongside
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-05.png	many others, we conducted our fight by putting
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-06.png	down # unambiguous alternatives to
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-07.png	official policy and seeking to win majorities
data/b06/b06-045/b06-045-08.png	for them.
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-00.png	The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-01.png	different in principle to the new defence statement.
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-02.png	They accept American nuclear bases, and also
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-03.png	the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-04.png	until some future date. They deceive the people
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-05.png	by their talk of political and collective control
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-06.png	of Nato. The Pentagon has made it perfectly
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-07.png	clear who controls the American H-bomb, and
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-08.png	who will actually give the instructions to press
data/b06/b06-082/b06-082-09.png	the button for nuclear warfare.
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-00.png	LESS has been heard of Brendan's work. It is now
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-01.png	five years since his first play, The Quare Fellow, was
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-02.png	produced, three years since Borstal Boy was published
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-03.png	and The Hostage was put on. What has happened to
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-04.png	the play, Richard's Cork Leg, begun 18 months ago
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-05.png	and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal,
data/c06/c06-047/c06-047-06.png	Stratford, last spring? It was never finished.
data/c06/c06-091/c06-091-00.png	It's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle, but I
data/c06/c06-091/c06-091-01.png	don't think it was through boredom. The film is funny enough
data/c06/c06-091/c06-091-02.png	in places and has a line or two of painful home truths
data/c06/c06-091/c06-091-03.png	thrown in. &quot;I don't want to talk like an adult,&quot; screams
data/c06/c06-091/c06-091-04.png	Gina, walking out on the man who has so far
data/c06/c06-091/c06-091-05.png	failed to make an honest woman of her.
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-00.png	Powerful units have stood firm.
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-01.png	In unions where the central issues
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-02.png	were confused, clear policy details -
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-03.png	as on bases - were decisively carried.
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-04.png	This, and the numbers of active
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-05.png	workers who are beginning to understand
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-06.png	how and why the trick was done,
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-07.png	provides a strong, immediate basis
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-08.png	for a campaign against weak and
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-09.png	doubtful positions, and for a consistent
data/b06/b06-064/b06-064-10.png	peace policy.
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-00.png	The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh,

data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-03.png	scientific revolution. Out of the 550,000
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-04.png	young people aged 15-17 starting
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-05.png	work in 1960 420000 (73 per cent)
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-06.png	went into unskilled work. The per-
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-07.png	centage is expected to swell to 80
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-08.png	next year. The Duke, possibly
data/b06/b06-100/b06-100-09.png	speaking from experience, stated:

data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-03.png	condition. His return to Dublin was
data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-04.png	heralded by the announcement that
data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-05.png	he was &quot;off the gargle - a retired
data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-06.png	alcoholic.&quot; Since then he has been
data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-07.png	heard of often in the newspapers -
data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-08.png	three times up before the beaks for
data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-09.png	drunk and disorderly conduct.

data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-00.png	The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's play A
data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-01.png	Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester Square Theatre
data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-02.png	tomorrow. It has been produced and directed by
data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-03.png	Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also part-author with
data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-04.png	Miss Delaney of the script, and the great advantages
data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-05.png	to be derived from this unity of conception and control
data/c03/c03-000b/c03-000b-06.png	are everywhere apparent.
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-01.png	throughout in terms of the cinema, and again and
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-02.png	again it is the visual qualities of the story, and
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-03.png	the marriage of the central characters to their
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-04.png	background, which bring the film so vividly to life.
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-05.png	In Fanny, which also has its premiere tomorrow,
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-06.png	the director, Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed
data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-07.png	to create the atmosphere of a city.
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken a
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-01.png	town in the industrial North of England and
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-02.png	has made it live. The shabby streets and wet pavements,
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-03.png	the school play-grounds, the public monuments and
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-04.png	the rubbish strewn canals - even the worn
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-05.png	head-stones in the churchyard, &quot;sacred to the
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-06.png	memory of&quot; - are seen as an integral part of
data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-07.png	the story.
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an intense
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-01.png	realism in the situation. A young girl lives in
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-02.png	a single dingy room with her slatternly,
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-03.png	promiscuous mother. In such surroundings she
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-04.png	learns sex is something sordid, and when she
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-05.png	experiences it for the first time herself it
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-06.png	is incoherently, clumsily, but half shyly and
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-07.png	half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny her
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-08.png	first lover is a sailor who leaves her to bear
data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-09.png	his child and sails away.
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an old
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-01.png	man. Here it is a young homosexual, estranged from
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-02.png	women but yet moved by a strong maternal instinct to
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-03.png	the unborn child as much as to the expectant mother,
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-04.png	who acts as a protector and comforter to her in her hour
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-05.png	of need. He shares her room and gives her his forlorn
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-06.png	gift of companionship and sympathy - "you need
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-07.png	someone to love you while you are looking for
data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-08.png	someone to love".
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-01.png	technical error in allowing Irene to speak for
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-02.png	herself; we would be altogether clearer in our
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-03.png	minds about her if she remained a flawed but
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-04.png	beautiful enigma, seen but not heard. However,
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-05.png	Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her few brief scenes
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-06.png	effective, and Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-07.png	the longest and most exacting role, that of the
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-08.png	sergeant, gives a performance of rare intelligence
data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-09.png	and restrained power.
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-00.png	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-01.png	effective, giving full value to the formal elements
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-02.png	of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-03.png	them. Last night's play in the "Play of the
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-04.png	Week" series on independent television, Then
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-05.png	We Fall, by Mr. Paul Ferris, was a morality
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-06.png	on the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
data/c03/c03-084b/c03-084b-07.png	power of unbridled ambition.
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-00.png	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-01.png	treatments of its subject by attempting to
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-02.png	generate a melodramatic inevitability which
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-03.png	left its central character and the world
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-04.png	around him in complete, unredeemable desolation.
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-05.png	We could, perhaps, say whether or not the attempt
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-06.png	succeeded if we had a little more faith in the
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-07.png	way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated
data/c03/c03-087b/c03-087b-08.png	his characters.
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-00.png	Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-01.png	insensitively pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-02.png	wife, always palely appealing, Mr. James Maxwell,
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-03.png	the editor, always comically abashed by the
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-04.png	events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the father-in-law,
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-05.png	always comically grotesque; they were not asked
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-06.png	to modulate from their set moods but played
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-07.png	with proper efficiency and, in the case of Mr.
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-08.png	Richards, with lavish and suitably gaudy
data/c03/c03-094b/c03-094b-09.png	colour.
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-01.png	explicably from appreciable motives. The
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-02.png	rest, one feels, were driven to effective action
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-03.png	by the author in spite of the ineffectuality
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-04.png	with which he had endowed them. One hopes
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-05.png	that he is not asking us to believe that,
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-06.png	because of their odd accents, they act oddly
data/c03/c03-096b/c03-096b-07.png	like the queer foreigners of tradition.

data/c04/c04-110/c04-110-01.png	assuredness &quot;Bella Bella Marie&quot; (Parlophone), a lively song that changes tempo mid-way.

data/c04/c04-110/c04-110-03.png	CHRIS CHARLES, 39, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees, is an accountant.
data/c04/c04-116/c04-116-00.png	He is also a director of a couple of garages. And he finds time as well to be a lyric
data/c04/c04-116/c04-116-01.png	writer. He writes with Tolchard Evans, composer of "Lady of Spain" and other big hits.
data/c04/c04-116/c04-116-02.png	Tolch, as he is known in Tin Pan Alley, likes songs with a month in the title. He wrote
data/c04/c04-116/c04-116-03.png	"My September Love," the big David Whitfield hit of 1956.
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-00.png	Say Granada T V, the producers: &quot;We decided to make
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-01.png	the switch because of the topicality of African
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-02.png	affairs. The Wesker interview will be seen at a later
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-03.png	date.&quot; ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-04.png	success last night in I T V's &quot;Private Potter,&quot; his
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-05.png	first big T V part. The play was a brilliantly-written
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-06.png	essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting
data/c04/c04-144/c04-144-07.png	man could only be regarded as a machine.
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-00.png	Potter screamed during an action, and was arrested. He
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-01.png	claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-02.png	C O believed him. Courtenay played the part with a gawky,
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-03.png	Northern defiance. The cameras played continuously on his
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-04.png	craggy face, and obstinate, baffled eyes. They stripped
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-05.png	him of his ugly battle-dress, to leave him for
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-06.png	what he was - Potter, a frightened boy who had a
data/c04/c04-150/c04-150-07.png	vision.
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-00.png	ALSO present is a London journalist who
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-01.png	arrived two hours earlier by appointment
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-02.png	to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-03.png	The Hostage about his new work, if any,
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-04.png	and who is now being pluckily convivial
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-05.png	to fight off the frustration. The telephone
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-06.png	has rung a couple of times, calls from
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-07.png	other chums sniffing the wind and
data/c06/c06-011/c06-011-08.png	offering to drop by for a chat.
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-00.png	To ridicule them only pushes them farther
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-01.png	into themselves, so that they become
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-02.png	unable to speak about it to anybody and
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-03.png	the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown,
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-04.png	the harvest of which may still be being
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-05.png	reaped at forty or fifty. Far better to
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-06.png	agree with a child that a particular
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-07.png	situation is frightening, and then to face
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-08.png	it together until the child can see how
data/d06/d06-008/d06-008-09.png	unnecessary its fears were.
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-00.png	In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-01.png	should pass from Him. Jesus shows us
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-02.png	the way to face life. To see all the latent
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-03.png	frightening possibilities and yet by facing
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-04.png	them and knowing God is with us and
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-05.png	that, with Him, there is nothing that can
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-06.png	finally defeat us. More than that, that God
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-07.png	has something important to do with our
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-08.png	lives and that the nearer we get to Him,
data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-09.png	the stronger we become.
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-00.png	Even more simply, test your own reactions
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-01.png	to different situations. There are some which
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-02.png	bring on an almost immediate feeling of
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-03.png	tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-04.png	the washing-up - while others, if they
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-05.png	refer to something you like doing, bring a
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-06.png	veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-07.png	is 'too tired to help mum' will later jump
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-08.png	up with no apparent tiredness at all when
data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-09.png	her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-00.png	In the days when most people were born,
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-01.png	lived and died within the boundaries of
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-02.png	the village, it was not difficult for anybody
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-03.png	to live a day at a time. Even those who
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-04.png	held a high and responsible office lived in
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-05.png	far greater simplicity than their successors.
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-06.png	When news from the Continent took days,
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-07.png	from America weeks, from the Far East,
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-08.png	months, even a Prime Minister could go to
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-09.png	sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-10.png	be happening at the other end of England,
data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-00.png	The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-01.png	the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-02.png	plan and to the different public for which, or against which, the author wrote.
data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-03.png	The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel.
data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-00.png	There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-01.png	Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The
data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-02.png	present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The
data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-03.png	original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was
data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-04.png	accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he
data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-05.png	could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-00.png	The most convenient one for the authors
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-01.png	has been the text of A. Souter. In this
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-02.png	version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-03.png	printed as just over 1,000 different nouns,
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-04.png	verbs, and other parts of speech occurring
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-05.png	15,695 times in their different grammatical
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-06.png	forms. There are other texts which could
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-07.png	have been used, and (as shown in Table 1)
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-08.png	it is not a matter of the greatest importance
data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-09.png	which text is used.
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-00.png	At first sight the difference between
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-01.png	Souter and the other texts is rather
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-02.png	large. But the British text includes
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-03.png	the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-04.png	taken in Adultery, and this accounts
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-05.png	for 178 words out of 279, which is
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-06.png	the difference between the 15,695 words
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-07.png	of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's.
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-08.png	The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-09.png	is a matter of editorial decision rather
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-00.png	Close to the building projects would be the
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-01.png	VINEYARDS (1 Kings 4.25; S. of Sol. 8.11).
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-02.png	The word is a Persian loan-word,
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-03.png	pairi-deaza, from which our word paradise
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-04.png	is derived. Qoheleth has a second
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-05.png	paradise at his disposal but he is
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-06.png	no happier than Adam was!
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-07.png	The word is used in the singular
data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-08.png	in Neh. 2.8 and S. of Sol. 4.13.
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-00.png	And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-01.png	just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-02.png	are used on Passover, to depict the &quot;time of our freedom&quot;.
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-03.png	And they are (1) Matzo; (2) Bitter Herbs; (3) Salt-water and
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-04.png	Charauses (a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-05.png	appearance of mortar); and (4) an attitude to lean
data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-06.png	back.
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-00.png	(1) Matzos is deficient bread, (LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew),
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-01.png	so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge, and to
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-02.png	cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-03.png	to learn. Education is always the most important task.
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-04.png	Education gives: Freedom of Speech. (2) Bitter Herbs
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-05.png	symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us.
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-06.png	We eat it. We accept it, to show we have self-control
data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-07.png	and that God dwells within us.
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-00.png	The new century opened with James 1 ascending
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-01.png	the throne. He was quite prepared to be
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-02.png	tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-03.png	spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-04.png	James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland,
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-05.png	but those hopes were dashed. True, a new Prayer
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-06.png	Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-07.png	derived little comfort from it.
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-00.png	This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-01.png	been the mood which produced the Black Rubric, for
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-02.png	it says that 'the Body and Blood of Christ, which are
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-03.png	verily and indeed taken and received by the
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-04.png	faithful in the Lord's Supper.' It could hardly be more
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-05.png	definite. It was at this time, too, that King James made
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-06.png	himself immortal by becoming associated with
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-07.png	a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-08.png	(which was never actually authorized!).
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-00.png	In that year Shakespeare had just turned
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-01.png	forty and had written Hamlet two years
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-02.png	before. Bacon was at work and Milton was
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-03.png	just learning to read. James was followed by
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-04.png	Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-05.png	Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-06.png	a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-07.png	became the foster mother of some of the most
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-08.png	important Prayer Books in the Anglican
data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-09.png	Communion.
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-00.png	Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud,
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-01.png	now so much nobler a figure than former historians
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-02.png	led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-03.png	by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-04.png	mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-05.png	first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-06.png	the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-07.png	with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,
data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-08.png	was necessarily a menace.
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-00.png	The mind tires first and conveys the impression
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-01.png	of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-02.png	noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-03.png	body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-04.png	a mother has news late at night that her
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-05.png	child is in danger. She will undertake a
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-06.png	journey which, an hour before, she would
data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-07.png	have declared impossible.
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-00.png	One of the greatest steps forward that has been
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-01.png	made this century is the way in which illness
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-02.png	of the mind is no longer feared or shunned,
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-03.png	and is in fact no differently regarded than
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-04.png	physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-05.png	great deal of tiredness which comes from
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-06.png	no major complication but results from an
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-07.png	inability to deal with life, especially under
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-08.png	the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-09.png	century.
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-00.png	The housewife would find life far less tiring
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-01.png	if she made a list, followed a routine of work
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-02.png	rather than getting from one thing to the next.
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-03.png	The business man would find that he reached
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-04.png	the end of the day with far less strain if
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-05.png	he was a little more systematic. To drift
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-06.png	aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-07.png	thing else. If we would only sit down and
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-08.png	write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-09.png	be done and then work quietly through them,
data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-10.png	we would find life considerably less exhausting
data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-00.png	She will, in fact, be surprised at what peace
data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-01.png	of mind ensues. (b) Concentrate on one
data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-02.png	thing at a time. A list or a plan enables us to
data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-03.png	put all our energies into the particular
data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-04.png	matter on hand.
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-00.png	Then they stop swimming and are caught. In
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-01.png	the seine-net film this usually seemed to
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-02.png	happen just after the fish had risen above
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-03.png	the footrope, and presumably out of its
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-04.png	field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-05.png	that the wave might be transmitted by the
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-06.png	sea-bed, though the footrope in this case
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-07.png	was actually just off the bottom and was
data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-08.png	indeed passing over some fish.
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-00.png	(Actually, the Mishnah quotes two further proof
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-01.png	texts and the Gemara explains why these,
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-02.png	too, are necessary, but a careful examination
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-03.png	of that passage makes it clear that these are
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-04.png	not quoted here because they are not
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-05.png	necessary to prove the point made by
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-06.png	R. Joshua b. Levi.) Finally, we note that
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-07.png	the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-08.png	elsewhere.
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-00.png	From the above it follows that here, once again,
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-01.png	we have a good illustration of how a
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-02.png	sugya has been fashioned from material
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-03.png	already in the hands of the Redactors.
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-04.png	The sugya is built around the saying of
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-05.png	R. Joshua b. Levi. The proof text for the
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-06.png	reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-07.png	with the comment given by Samuel.
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-00.png	(This is probably to be understood as a well-
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-01.png	known comment on the verse; quoted by
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-02.png	Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-03.png	by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-04.png	Levi's thesis!) The proof text of greeting by
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-05.png	the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah.
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-06.png	There is no reference to the Mishnah here
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-07.png	because the Mishnah deals with the
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-08.png	actual practice of greeting by the divine
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-09.png	Name and the Gemara here quotes the
data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-10.png	texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-00.png	The question and answer with regard to the
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-01.png	need for the text of the angel are quoted
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-02.png	here in the same words in which they are
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-03.png	quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah.
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-04.png	This can either mean that both sugyas are
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-05.png	quoting a well-known question and
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-06.png	answer or that our sugya is quoting from
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-07.png	the longer sugya which deals with all
data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-08.png	four texts quoted in the Mishnah.
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-00.png	Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-01.png	original question and answer and this is quoted
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-02.png	in the other sugya. (This can be supported by the
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-03.png	use of the expression: 'Boaz did it of his own
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-04.png	accord but there was no approval of his action
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-05.png	in Heaven' in both sugyoth. Such an
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-06.png	expression appears to have been framed in
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-07.png	response to the particular point at issue here,
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-08.png	whether the Heavenly Court concurred
data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-09.png	in the decision of the human court.)
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-00.png	The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-01.png	is then quoted and the interpretation of the
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-02.png	latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-03.png	is added, not because this is at all relevant
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-04.png	to the discussion but because it was
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-05.png	a familiar interpretation which had
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-06.png	become so well known that it was
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-07.png	invariably quoted whenever the verse
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-08.png	itself was quoted, almost as if it were a
data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-09.png	part of the verse.
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-00.png	The Gemara continues with a saying of the
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-01.png	Palestinian teacher, R. Eleazar (3rd Cent.):
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-02.png	'The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places:
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-03.png	the court of Shem, the court of Samuel of Ramah,
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-04.png	and the court of Solomon.' The place of this
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-05.png	saying here is obvious, it follows naturally
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-06.png	on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-07.png	deals with a similar theme.
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-00.png	During the sixteenth century a considerable
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-01.png	amount of crochet was produced in the
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-02.png	convents of Europe. Without doubt it was the
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-03.png	nuns who carried the craft to Ireland. There it
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-04.png	was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-05.png	form with rosettes, leaves and lace fillings. During
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-06.png	the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-07.png	greatly abused.
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-00.png	In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-01.png	hand-crocheted blouses, gossamer fine in
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-02.png	texture, are sold at a very high price. With a
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-03.png	little time and concentration the woman at home can
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-04.png	produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-05.png	Paris - a blouse, delicate gloves or a fine
data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-06.png	edging for collar, cuffs or a handkerchief.
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-00.png	In the home, crochet lace can be used to make
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-01.png	tablecloths, traycloths and runners, and edgings
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-02.png	from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-03.png	functions. The art of crochet is not difficult and
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-04.png	it is reasonably quick to work. In the following
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-05.png	pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-06.png	to enable the beginner to master all the essential
data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-07.png	crochet stitches.
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-00.png	Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-01.png	timber as shown in Fig. 1. Although the timber will have already
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-02.png	been machine planed, remember to go over each piece with
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-03.png	a smoothing plane, otherwise the marks left by the cutters
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-04.png	will show up after painting. The dimensions given enable the
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-05.png	feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table, but the height
data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-06.png	can be altered if required.
data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-00.png	All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned,
data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-01.png	which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-02.png	appearance. The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-03.png	each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses (C),
data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-04.png	cut to fit them.
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-00.png	The chine is the long stringer on each side which
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-01.png	is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-02.png	cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak,
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-03.png	ash, spruce or any long grained flexible wood. I
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-04.png	prefer spruce when available. As will be seen
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-05.png	in the plan, the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.
data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-06.png	on each side.
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-00.png	However, something inimical in the girl's look
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-01.png	put Vittoria on guard. 'Santa Maria! These spying
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-02.png	eyes!' she thought, bitterly. Doria was continually
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-03.png	stopping on the way, to point out, with childish pride,
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-04.png	objects of beauty or interest. Vittoria, on the
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-05.png	fringe of the party, caught snatches of this
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-06.png	information, which held no interest for her:
data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-07.png	'... now this sapphire ...
data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-00.png	The chines are morticed into this and butt up
data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-01.png	against the transom. Start at the bow and
data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-02.png	spring them both at the same time over the
data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-03.png	slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-04.png	cut for this purpose in the stern or after
data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-05.png	transom framing. Glue, screw and make fast.
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-00.png	The skeleton of the boat will now take shape,
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-01.png	and this is the time to check before making fast
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-02.png	to see that nothing is distorted. Ensure that
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-03.png	the outside measurements from transom to transom
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-04.png	are equal on each side and that the transoms
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-05.png	are parallel horizontally. Next bevel the chines
data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-06.png	with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly.
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-00.png	Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-01.png	plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-02.png	planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-03.png	lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-04.png	purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-05.png	the other. If care is taken not to waste the
data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-06.png	ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.
data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-00.png	While these may ultimately be made into a picture
data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-01.png	for framing and hanging on a wall, they may
data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-02.png	also be arranged into a design, and the
data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-03.png	resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-04.png	article.
data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-00.png	Again, don't forget to glue. Now put on the keel and
data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-01.png	the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-02.png	the moulds. You won't want them again for this boat, so
data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-03.png	shift them right out of the way. Place the boat right side
data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-04.png	up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-05.png	working.
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-00.png	Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts (seats)
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-01.png	taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-02.png	with vertical members as shown in the plans. Make the
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-03.png	four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-04.png	before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-05.png	a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside (gunwale)
data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-06.png	one to fit the block.
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-00.png	I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-01.png	with copper nails and roves. It greatly improves the
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-02.png	appearance and the strength. Paint with good marine primer,
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-03.png	undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint.
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-04.png	WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-05.png	into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-06.png	making fabric pictures or designs.
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-00.png	The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-01.png	vocabulary to work on the existing store
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-02.png	so as to make it grow. He does not
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-03.png	simply pack new things into the store.
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-04.png	The solitary learner has to find out
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-05.png	how to do this for himself, with the help
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-06.png	of books. He uses his vocabulary to
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-07.png	ask questions and uses the books to
data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-08.png	find the answers.
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-00.png	Thus learning how to learn means becoming
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-01.png	your own philosopher, your own psychologist
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-02.png	and your own teacher. You will then be
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-03.png	a well-established learner and the world
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-04.png	will be at your feet. Although the word
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-05.png	&quot;mind&quot; has given rise to endless
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-06.png	controversy among philosophers and psycho-
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-07.png	logists, many of whom would like to
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-08.png	abolish it from the dictionary, most
data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-09.png	of us obstinately go on using it.
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-00.png	It is the tendency to get things
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-01.png	the wrong way round. As a
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-02.png	psychologist I am constantly
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-03.png	encountering this tendency
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-04.png	in friends and acquaintances.
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-05.png	They think there is something
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-06.png	inevitably &quot;queer&quot; about psychology
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-07.png	and this feeling of queerness
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-08.png	usually boils down to a quite
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-09.png	mistaken belief that the
data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-10.png	psychologist first looks into ...
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-00.png	And so they prefer objective methods. Since they cannot
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-01.png	directly look into the mental processes of another
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-02.png	person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-03.png	to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-04.png	this behaviour. This is no more queer than the method
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-05.png	of the doctor who observes signs, and records symptoms,
data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-06.png	and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them.
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-00.png	He may never have had the disease himself but he
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-01.png	can nevertheless identify it. Similarly the psychologist has
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-02.png	to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-03.png	all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-04.png	correspond with anything in his own experience. We know
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-05.png	very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-06.png	provide our schemas, nor do we need to know as far as
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-07.png	psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-08.png	the neuro-physiologists.
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-00.png	The weekend conference for the men and their wives,
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-01.png	which takes place at company expense in a country or
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-02.png	resort hotel, includes an address on 'The Woman's Point
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-03.png	of View' and one on 'Making the Most of Health'. Separate
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-04.png	discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-05.png	plenary sessions. Of the men reaching fifty years of age
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-06.png	since the scheme started, 125 (37.2 per cent) have
data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-07.png	taken part.
data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-00.png	Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body, which
data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-01.png	had at first been considered as belonging to the killer,
data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-02.png	proved yet another red herring, for it was learned that
data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-03.png	they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-04.png	of her sisters. A young man from Reading named Marshall
data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-05.png	had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner.
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-00.png	This man was known to have left his home on February 11, and
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-01.png	to have been away for four days. Not in itself a crime, but, added to
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-02.png	the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-03.png	dford for a false moustache, it left him with something to
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-04.png	explain. His story was that he had left home to try to
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-05.png	join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-06.png	his military bearing), and this was accepted.
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-00.png	It was the battered and broken body of a woman.
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-01.png	He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-02.png	Station, and a stretcher party took the body to
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-03.png	the Feathers Hotel to await identification.
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-04.png	Was it a case of suicide, where some unhappy soul
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-05.png	had walked deliberately into the blackness and
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-06.png	into the path of some train? This hardly seemed
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-07.png	likely, since, when she was examined by a local
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-08.png	doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump,
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-09.png	was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-10.png	almost tight enough to strangle her, and the ends
data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-11.png	thrust in her mouth like a gag.
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-00.png	Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising,
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-01.png	and there were other injuries on her body which had
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-02.png	occurred before her death was ensured by some
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-03.png	train which had roared through the tunnel. There were
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-04.png	no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-05.png	fication, no money, and no railway ticket. By then
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-06.png	reports were being gathered about all traffic over
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-07.png	this stretch of line, but no information was
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-08.png	forthcoming about any carriage with an open
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-09.png	door, nor any passenger reporting an incident
data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-10.png	which might relate.
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-00.png	There was no abatement in political
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-01.png	work. The British Socialist Party endea-
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-02.png	voured to get more socialist members sent to the
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-03.png	Council, and to Parliament, being deter-
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-04.png	mined and obdurate in their attitude that
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-05.png	their candidate must go forward in the
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-06.png	elections. In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-07.png	Council meeting on October 16, 1912, George
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-08.png	had said, 'Mr. Barton would go to the poll.
data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-09.png	Just as the Labour Party had fought the

data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-00.png	Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-01.png	co-operation especially with the other Christian communities.
data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-02.png	At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-03.png	'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees
data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-04.png	I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help
data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-05.png	wives and relations of the soldiers to get their 'Separation'

data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-08.png	became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman
data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-09.png	of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-00.png	Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-01.png	Purley, and from 1922 at Surbiton, I was continuously
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-02.png	Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-03.png	task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-04.png	the Committee. We had a splendid body of local residents,
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-05.png	and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-06.png	Committee met once a week in the evenings, and
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-07.png	included professional men from every walk of
data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-08.png	life.
data/g06/g06-011g/g06-011g-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples. He told
data/g06/g06-011g/g06-011g-01.png	Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his health
data/g06/g06-011g/g06-011g-02.png	permitted him to enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is

data/g06/g06-018g/g06-018g-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl back to
data/g06/g06-018g/g06-018g-01.png	England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In late
data/g06/g06-018g/g06-018g-02.png	November, he was 'suffering as usual', but hoped, he told

data/g06/g06-037g/g06-037g-03.png	While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter in
data/g06/g06-037g/g06-037g-04.png	the history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an effective
data/g06/g06-037g/g06-037g-05.png	alleviation of his painful malady. None of the numerous
data/g06/g06-037g/g06-037g-06.png	conventional remedies to which he had been subjected
data/g06/g06-037g/g06-037g-07.png	ever since the symptoms had first shown themselves
data/g06/g06-037g/g06-037g-08.png	seventeen years before had had the slightest effect.
data/g06/g06-042g/g06-042g-00.png	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today, in the 1960s,
data/g06/g06-042g/g06-042g-01.png	no cure has been found for the 6tic douloureux. As
data/g06/g06-042g/g06-042g-02.png	early as 1830, when Anglesey believed himself to be on the
data/g06/g06-042g/g06-042g-03.png	point of death, the new German curative method known as
data/g06/g06-042g/g06-042g-04.png	homoeopathy had been brought to his notice.
data/g06/g06-045g/g06-045g-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law, the
data/g06/g06-045g/g06-045g-01.png	diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to advise Anglesey
data/g06/g06-045g/g06-045g-02.png	to give the system a trial, adding that it was being cultivated
data/g06/g06-045g/g06-045g-03.png	with extraordinary success in France and Italy, and that he
data/g06/g06-045g/g06-045g-04.png	himself was being treated under a doctor who had studied
data/g06/g06-045g/g06-045g-05.png	under its founder, the aged Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
data/g06/g06-047g/g06-047g-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
data/g06/g06-047g/g06-047g-01.png	Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
data/g06/g06-047g/g06-047g-02.png	'more like a God upon earth than a human being', had an
data/g06/g06-047g/g06-047g-03.png	increasing number of disciples among unorthodox medical

data/g06/g06-047g/g06-047g-05.png	Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-01.png	at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for advice. In doing so he
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-02.png	described his distinguished patient and his symptoms. He told
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-03.png	Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic man
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-04.png	with a gentle and charming character, even-tempered and
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-05.png	sedate, not easily irritated, patient and persevering, 'but he
data/g06/g06-050g/g06-050g-06.png	appears to despair of ever being cured.'

data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-04.png	While he was in Naples there had
data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-05.png	opened a new chapter in the history
data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-06.png	of Anglesey's unceasing search for an
data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-07.png	effective alleviation of his painful mala-
data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-08.png	dy. None of the numerous conventional
data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-09.png	remedies to which he had been subjected
data/g06/g06-037o/g06-037o-10.png	ever since the symptoms had first
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-00.png	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-01.png	today, in the 1960s, no cure has been
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-02.png	found for the 6tic douloureux. As early
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-03.png	as 1830, when Anglesey believed him-
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-04.png	self to be on the point of death,
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-05.png	the new German curative method
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-06.png	known as homoeopathy had been
data/g06/g06-042o/g06-042o-07.png	brought to his notice.
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's bro-
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-01.png	ther-in-law, the diplomatist Lord Pon-
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-02.png	sonby, had written to advise Anglesey
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-03.png	to give the system a trial, adding that it
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-04.png	was being cultivated with extraordinary
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-05.png	success in France and Italy, and that
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-06.png	he himself was being treated under
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-07.png	a doctor who had studied under
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-08.png	its founder, the aged Dr. Samuel
data/g06/g06-045o/g06-045o-09.png	Hahnemann.
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-01.png	Sir Francis Burdett described to Anglesey
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-02.png	a year or two later as 'more like a God
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-03.png	upon earth than a human being', had
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-04.png	an increasing number of disciples among
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-05.png	unorthodox medical men in the cities
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-06.png	of Europe. One of these was the Neapo-
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-07.png	litan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey
data/g06/g06-047o/g06-047o-08.png	consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his re-
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-01.png	vered master at Ko"then, near Leipzig,
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-02.png	asking for advice. In doing so he descri-
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-03.png	bed his distinguished patient and his
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-04.png	symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-05.png	Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-06.png	gentle and charming character, even-tem-
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-07.png	pered and sedate, not easily irritated,
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-08.png	patient and persevering, 'but he appears
data/g06/g06-050o/g06-050o-09.png	to despair of ever being cured.'
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-00.png	Later in the year, the idea of some sort of
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-01.png	public employment was again in the air. Lady
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-02.png	Cowper, for instance, told Princess Lieven on
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-03.png	September 25th that Anglesey was very much
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-04.png	annoyed at not obtaining the Admiralty in place
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-05.png	of Lord Auckland, who had gone to govern India.
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-06.png	If there was any truth in this, Lord Melbourne's
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-07.png	letter of the following day, offering Anglesey the
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-08.png	Government of Gibraltar, may have been a
data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-09.png	sop.
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-00.png	'It is', he wrote, 'one of the best military situations
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-01.png	which the Crown has to bestow - the salary has
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-02.png	been settled... at five thousand pounds yearly, it
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-03.png	being understood that the Governor is not here-
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-04.png	after to be absent from his post. It has struck
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-05.png	me that 1altho' very improbable it is not quite
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-06.png	impossible that you might be willing to accept of
data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-07.png	this appointment.'
data/g06/g06-096/g06-096-00.png	The reply was not bereft of asperity: 'Beaudesert,
data/g06/g06-096/g06-096-01.png	Sept. 27, 1835 'Dear Melbourne, 'I have received
data/g06/g06-096/g06-096-02.png	your letter of yesterday. 'I am not prepared to spend

data/g06/g06-096/g06-096-05.png	no taste for a sinecure, I have only to thank

data/g06/g06-101/g06-101-01.png	Soon after his return from Europe, Clarence Paget
data/g06/g06-101/g06-101-02.png	had become seriously ill with a supposed abscess
data/g06/g06-101/g06-101-03.png	on the lungs. After months of suffering, his life was
data/g06/g06-101/g06-101-04.png	almost despaired of when as a last resort it was
data/g06/g06-101/g06-101-05.png	suggested that the patient should be taken to consult
data/g06/g06-101/g06-101-06.png	Hahnemann once again.
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-00.png	It was no longer necessary to go further than Paris,
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-01.png	for by this time the great man had been driven
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-02.png	from his native Germany by the antipathy of his
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-03.png	orthodox brethren. The main difficulty was how to
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-04.png	make the expedition from England without killing the
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-05.png	patient before he completed it. The problem was
data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-06.png	overcome in an interesting manner.
data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-00.png	'Fortunately,' wrote Clarence in after years, 'the
data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-01.png	King... remembered there was a luxurious old bed

data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-03.png	had carried his brother, George 4., and he kindly
data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-04.png	placed it at the disposal of my father. Into it I was
data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-05.png	put, more dead than alive, and we got across to
data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-06.png	Calais, and from thence by easy stages to
data/g06/g06-109/g06-109-07.png	Paris...
data/g06/g06-115/g06-115-00.png	He wrote down every symptom, examined me all
data/g06/g06-115/g06-115-01.png	over, asked ever so many questions which I had
data/g06/g06-115/g06-115-02.png	scarcely strength to answer, and took up his gold-
data/g06/g06-115/g06-115-03.png	headed cane to depart. My father hung upon every
data/g06/g06-115/g06-115-04.png	word, but could get nothing from him.
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-00.png	To provide fuller information about certain types of
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-01.png	dangerous occurrence, Section 65 of the Factories Act,
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-02.png	1937, requires notification of certain specified
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-03.png	occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories,
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-04.png	whether or not they result in injury. Appendix 20
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-05.png	gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-06.png	1960; the types of occurrence which have to be
data/h06/h06-000/h06-000-07.png	reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix.
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-00.png	The total number of dangerous occurrences reported
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-01.png	during the year was 1,409, an increase of 111 over
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-02.png	the total for 1959. However, the number of
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-03.png	notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-04.png	from 252 (31 of them fatal) in 1959 to
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-05.png	245 (22 fatal) in 1960. The main increase in
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-06.png	the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-07.png	category of those due to the collapse or
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-08.png	failure of a crane, derrick, winch or hoist, where
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-09.png	there was an increase of almost one-third from
data/h06/h06-003/h06-003-10.png	335 to 438.
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-00.png	Hanson, the solicitor, was naturally remunerated
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-01.png	for his services, but all Mr Hobhouse's duties
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-02.png	as executor were performed without reward.
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-03.png	And now there was more trouble brewing
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-04.png	with those unbearable Dallases. Dallas
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-05.png	senior was detained in Paris by severe
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-06.png	illness, but Dallas junior was full of
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-07.png	fight and applying for the injunction
data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-08.png	to be lifted.
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-00.png	He had gone to Byron's cousin, now 7th
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-01.png	lord, and had got him to compose an
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-02.png	affidavit to the effect that, whereas he
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-03.png	had formerly been reluctant to approve the
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-04.png	publication unless it had first been
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-05.png	examined by the relatives and friends of
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-06.png	his predecessor, he had now read the
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-07.png	book and was content for it to be
data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-08.png	issued without that precaution.
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-00.png	There were few things in Augusta's whole
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-01.png	life, full of calamities though it was, that
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-02.png	hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-03.png	from George Anson Byron, whom she had
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-04.png	loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-05.png	on as her intimate friend. Moreover, he
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-06.png	was without the right to make such
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-07.png	pronouncements: he had inherited nothing
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-08.png	from her brother but his title, whereas
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-09.png	she was not only of nearer consanguinity
data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-10.png	but the chosen recipient of his property.
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-00.png	These, if she had only known it, were
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-01.png	precisely the reasons why her cousin took
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-02.png	pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her.
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-03.png	Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-04.png	intimate friends, and in every instance where
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-05.png	the occasion was granted her, she managed
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-06.png	to find some excuse for bestowing, in whole
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-07.png	or in part, those confidences which never
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-08.png	failed to leave her audience agape with
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-09.png	wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-10.png	wickedness.
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-00.png	George Anson Byron had seen enough of
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-01.png	the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-02.png	to be aware that Augusta, so far from
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-03.png	being responsible for the collapse of the
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-04.png	marriage, had been Lady Byron's greatest
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-05.png	support and comfort at the time; but it
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-06.png	had been deemed necessary all the
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-07.png	same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-08.png	in the background, and he had repeated
data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-09.png	them to his newly married wife.
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-00.png	A new question asked about housing tenure, whether
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-01.png	the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-02.png	them as owner-occupiers; occupied in connection with
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-03.png	employment or as part of business premises; rented
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-04.png	from a Council (or New Town Corporation) or a private
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-05.png	landlord (if so, whether furnished or unfurnished); or
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-06.png	occupied on some other terms. The analysis of private
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-07.png	households by size and various characteristics of their
data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-08.png	members has become increasingly important.

data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-00.png	We have held eleven meetings. We decided as a
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-01.png	first step to seek information from a number
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-02.png	of organisations and persons having an interest
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-03.png	in the questions before us and at a later stage we
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-04.png	arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-05.png	anybody interested to submit representations. We
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-06.png	compiled a list of the points which we thought
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-07.png	were of importance, but we made it clear that
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-08.png	the replies need not be confined to these
data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-09.png	particular items.
data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-00.png	13. It appeared then that in some circumstances
data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-01.png	dangerous drugs were being supplied in
data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-02.png	contravention of the intention of Parliament
data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-03.png	that a doctor should be authorised to supply

data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-00.png	The Secretary of State was empowered, on the recommendation of a
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-01.png	tribunal, to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-02.png	dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor, or a doctor
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-03.png	convicted of an offence under the Act, should not issue
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-04.png	prescriptions for dangerous drugs. (3) It was made clear
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-05.png	that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-06.png	medical practitioner when required for purposes of
data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-07.png	medical treatment.
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-00.png	Except at Hemel Hempstead, large office
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-01.png	organisations have until quite recently shown
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-02.png	little interest in the new towns, probably because of
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-03.png	the difficulty in the early years in recruiting
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-04.png	suitable staff, especially junior staff, locally.
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-05.png	There is evidence of greater interest today,
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-06.png	with nearly half a million square feet of
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-07.png	office space under construction - almost as
data/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-08.png	much as the total area so far completed.
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-00.png	This interest is likely to grow as employers become
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-01.png	aware of the advantages of setting up offices in towns
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-02.png	with a young and growing population and excellent
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-03.png	schools and technical colleges. Towards the end of
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-04.png	the year the Minister wrote personally to some two
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-05.png	hundred chairmen of companies with large offices
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-06.png	in central London, drawing their attention to the
data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-07.png	opportunities offered by the new towns.
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-00.png	The development corporations have provided office
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-01.png	accommodation (in addition to that included in factory
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-02.png	premises) in the form of buildings specially designed to meet
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-03.png	the needs of particular organisations, and have also
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-04.png	erected some buildings as a speculative venture.
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-05.png	Despite some misgivings, these have readily let on satis-
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-06.png	factory terms, including in many cases a break clause in
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-07.png	the lease allowing for a future increase in rent to reflect
data/h07/h07-060a/h07-060a-08.png	rising values in the town.
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-00.png	More modest premises are provided on the upper floors over
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-01.png	shops in some of the town centres for the small type of
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-02.png	office organisation. Government departments with branches
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-03.png	established or about to be established in the new towns include
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-04.png	Her Majesty's Stationery Office at Basildon, the Meteorological
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-05.png	Office at Bracknell, the Admiralty (who have a research labora-
data/h07/h07-063a/h07-063a-06.png	tory at Harlow), the General Post Office and the Ministry of

data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-00.png	Local offices of the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of National
data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-01.png	Insurance and Inland Revenue are of course established or
data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-02.png	proposed in all the towns. Because of the abnormal age structure
data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-03.png	of the new town populations the number of children reaching
data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-04.png	school-leaving age, expressed as a percentage of the
data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-05.png	total population, has been and still is below the
data/h07/h07-066a/h07-066a-06.png	national average.
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-00.png	Provided the temperatures at C and E are
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-01.png	the same, thermoelectric contributions to the
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-02.png	voltage should be zero. The probe extends
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-03.png	out of the sodium stream through a close
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-04.png	fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-05.png	into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G.
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-06.png	The open end of the probe is sealed with
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-07.png	a vacuum coupling H which also positions
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-08.png	the +ve nickel conductor with respect
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-09.png	to the sodium by circlips on either side
data/j01/j01-059/j01-059-10.png	of the seal I.
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-00.png	Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-01.png	minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-02.png	block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-03.png	conductor by nickel circlips. Fixing and
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-04.png	positioning of the probe relative to the coolant
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-05.png	stream is effected by tie-bars of insulating
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-06.png	material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the
data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-07.png	water cooled flange G.
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-00.png	The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-01.png	via the tube L which must of course be electrically
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-02.png	isolated after this has been carried out. It is not
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-03.png	suggested that the above proposal will be successful
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-04.png	but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-05.png	the inadequacy of some simpler method of
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-06.png	monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit. The
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-07.png	principal difficulty encountered by the author, in
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-08.png	determining partial molal free energies by solid
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-09.png	electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2,
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-10.png	MnO etc. was vapour phase transfer of oxygen by
data/j01/j01-066/j01-066-11.png	carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas.
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-00.png	Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-01.png	precipitates need be known because the concentration
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-02.png	of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-03.png	algebraic equations. An effort was made to
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-04.png	detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-05.png	the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-06.png	bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-07.png	of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-08.png	minutes of completing the separation.
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-00.png	If there is sufficient beta activity, the radioche-
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-01.png	mical purity of the Bi-210 may be checked
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-02.png	by observing the decay curve. The removal of lead
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-03.png	chromate from the aluminium counting tray together
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-04.png	with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-05.png	exchange separation has been checked by
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-06.png	counting the trays. Not more than 0.2 of the
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-07.png	bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-08.png	acid wash.
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-00.png	Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-01.png	way to the Accoramboni villa, ostensibly to pay
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-02.png	a daughterly call on her father, actually to coax
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-03.png	money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-04.png	debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-05.png	looked, and how cunningly the olive-green dress
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-06.png	with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-07.png	perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more complex.
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-00.png	The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-01.png	of Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-02.png	restless spirit, all threw into sharp relief the contrast
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-03.png	of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-04.png	her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien,
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-05.png	and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-06.png	to give her a separate establishment, he invariably
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-07.png	pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who
data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-08.png	had built the villa for his family.
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-00.png	This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-01.png	sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop, nearly throwing
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-02.png	the two girls from their seats. Lucia uttered a cry of
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-03.png	alarm. 'Look, madonna, we are surrounded!' It was true.
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-04.png	Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-05.png	them and a lean, swarthy fellow was peering through
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-06.png	the window, grinning impudently. 'Santa Maria!'
data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-07.png	shrieked Lucia. 'Banditti!'
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-00.png	Vittoria now realized that they were outside
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-01.png	Santa Maria degli Angeli, and that except for a few beggars
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-02.png	crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-03.png	loathsome sores, the area was deserted. 'They are not banditti,
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-04.png	Lucia,' said Vittoria, pointing to the badge on the man's
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-05.png	shoulder. The words were clear. 'Beware my hug!' Lucia
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-06.png	stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-07.png	averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-08.png	of the retainer.
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-00.png	Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-01.png	coach now turned in another direction, towards
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-02.png	the wild and desolate region behind the baths.
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-03.png	It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-04.png	and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-05.png	a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic
data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-06.png	reminder of Rome's former greatness.
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-00.png	In this region of Monti most of the public baths
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-01.png	had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-02.png	breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-03.png	the baths had lost their purpose; they had become
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-04.png	stone quarries and their precious marble had been
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-05.png	burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-06.png	used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger
data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-07.png	of travellers in the district.
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-00.png	As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-01.png	could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-02.png	gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-03.png	gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-04.png	were left far behind. An old man belabouring an
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-05.png	overladen donkey, and a withered crone appeared
data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-06.png	on the horizon, were overtaken and forgotten.
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-00.png	The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-01.png	the future would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-02.png	her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-03.png	hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-04.png	its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-05.png	was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in
data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-06.png	French to Vittoria: 'Your maid ... is she reliable?'
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-00.png	Except for their escort, Vittoria and
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-01.png	Lucia might have been the only living
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-02.png	creatures on an empty planet. After the
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-03.png	initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-04.png	knew exactly what she wanted, and
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-05.png	was prepared to take it without scruple,
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-06.png	if she could. What she had forgotten
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-07.png	in her self-absorption in her own schemes
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-08.png	was that other people were equally absorbed
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-09.png	in their schemes, which were likely to
data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-10.png	run counter to her own.
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-00.png	This move today was a reminder of that fact.
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-01.png	Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-02.png	the agitated Lucia, her brain was working
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-03.png	rapidly, and she decided that she must be
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-04.png	prepared to counter Orsini's demands,
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-05.png	difficult though that would be. She became
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-06.png	aware that the pace was slackening;
data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-07.png	now the coach stopped.
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-00.png	To observe the colour rise in her cheek
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-01.png	and hear her breath come faster, to see
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-02.png	the slight beads of sweat come out on
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-03.png	her glistening skin and see her move
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-04.png	with uncontrolled rhythm. To have her twist
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-05.png	in an attempt to receive a caress he was
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-06.png	purposely withholding, to hear her deep-throated
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-07.png	moan of full satisfaction and feel her
data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-08.png	shivering, clawing surrender.
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-00.png	Not so dusty, she might say afterwards, drawing at
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-01.png	a cigarette. It's a wow! he said. She kissed
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-02.png	him motherly: You just wait till you teach the
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-03.png	girl you really love. He didn't protest any more
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-04.png	to say he loved her because he knew it to
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-05.png	be untrue. Instead he said: Will that be
data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-06.png	better? She nodded:
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-00.png	It's man's nature to teach and to teach those
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-01.png	we love is double pleasure. And she
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-02.png	might add: And don't forget to leave the
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-03.png	lights on. You lose half the fun when you
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-04.png	fumble in the dark. She had many direct
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-05.png	comments like that. Once she quietly
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-06.png	pushed him back when he kissed her too
data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-07.png	fully and too soon:
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-00.png	Oi, not yet, you oaf. What do you think my
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-01.png	mouth is? A billposter's bucket to be
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-02.png	plunged in at random? He'd learned to
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-03.png	laugh when something went wrong or the
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-04.png	situation became ludicrous, as when they
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-05.png	were both caught in the raw when he'd
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-06.png	forgotten to lock his door and Derek
data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-07.png	had walked in unexpectedly.
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-00.png	They'd just had time to nip into the
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-01.png	bathroom and stood there shivering for
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-02.png	fifteen minutes while their guest was
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-03.png	smoking a cigarette waiting for him.
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-04.png	At last Derek got tired and left.
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-05.png	Just in time, erupted Charlie. If he'd
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-06.png	stayed any longer I'd jolly well
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-07.png	have asked him to join us. I'm so
data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-08.png	darned cold I could do with two men.
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-00.png	He sponged off him until he died
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-01.png	just after the war. Then Pete had to
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-02.png	look around for some other
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-03.png	security. He found it - Dackson's Wharf,
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-04.png	and Dackson's daughter. Mrs. Caxton's
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-05.png	other boy, Derek, had been killed in the war.
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-06.png	After her husband died her brain began
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-07.png	to fade. At times she thought Pete was
data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-08.png	really her own son.
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-00.png	&quot;Imagine it, Nick, just that bit of information
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-01.png	Fred picked up about Pete Jesty always touching
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-02.png	his nose, and me remembering from that
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-03.png	snap you once showed me that this Cax-
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-04.png	ton had some sort of a scar there. Just
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-05.png	an idea to begin with, mind you - then
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-06.png	click! and I'd got it. That was smart
data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-07.png	work, say what you like.&quot;
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-00.png	Sentence Database L04-082
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-01.png	But he was still no sort of match for a young
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-02.png	and virile competitor and he knew it. He turned
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-03.png	away and begun to undress, shivering with the
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-04.png	cold. His eye automatically glanced towards the
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-05.png	panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-06.png	secret treasure. For an instant he stood
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-07.png	transfixed to the floor, his eyes unwavering
data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-08.png	as they riveted themselves on the wall.
data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-00.png	His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat,
data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-01.png	as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-02.png	brought forward. He mouthed a low mutter, punctuated at intervals
data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-03.png	with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon. As
data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-04.png	Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut,
data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-05.png	with jaws askew.
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-00.png	He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-01.png	and came into the livingroom, where
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-02.png	Heather and Steve stood aghast at
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-03.png	his entrance. He came, almost falling
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-04.png	forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-05.png	thrust out, arms dangling loosely.
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-06.png	Then, abruptly, he drew himself up
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-07.png	and walked on the very tips of
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-08.png	his toes. He stretched his arms
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-09.png	over his head and yawned agape,
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-10.png	drawing-in great breaths that
data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-11.png	became great sighs of ecstacy.
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-00.png	At the centre of each circle stood personnel
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-01.png	managers of corporations, together with professors
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-02.png	and their filing clerks. The students had
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-03.png	bought their college education forward and
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-04.png	were now being bought forward in their
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-05.png	turn. By comparing personal appearances
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-06.png	with university records, the agents of the
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-07.png	businesses would pick on young men
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-08.png	and women who interested them, and contracts
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-09.png	would be initialled at the end of
data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-10.png	the parade.
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-00.png	'Something's up,' said Lord Undertone,
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-01.png	carefully casual. 'The servants are all on
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-02.png	edge... did you notice? And the mules
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-03.png	didn't seem to want to get off the raft.'
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-04.png	He peered as it were into the dark secrets
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-05.png	of the jungle. 'Think there's Indians
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-06.png	about?' It was most certainly an eerie
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-07.png	night, exceptionally brilliant and strange,
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-08.png	for in the proximity of the mountains,
data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-09.png	whose presence I could almost smell,
data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-00.png	Hope I die kind of composed, Trout. I mean you can't
data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-01.png	imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking,
data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-02.png	no matter how bad it felt, the fire you know, or a
data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-03.png	lion munching, or arrows where it hurts most. Or
data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-04.png	can you. Look over there.' He pointed to the
data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-05.png	shadows beyond the river. 'Something moved.'
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-00.png	I had a distinct impression that the
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-01.png	hut had recently been cleaned and
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-02.png	prepared for visitors. Mrs Caine said
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-03.png	we were to go no further unless and
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-04.png	until we were sent for, confirming
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-05.png	another impression that became more
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-06.png	and more definite, namely, that
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-07.png	she was in touch with an invi-
data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-08.png	sible source of authority.
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-00.png	They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-01.png	on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port.
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-02.png	He was able to trace the course of the river; he
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-03.png	thought he could recognise the route of N12,
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-04.png	along which he had motored so desperately little
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-05.png	more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-06.png	he had flown to England, attended the vital
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-07.png	conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-08.png	by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-09.png	Parade to Boscombe Down, slept for six blessed
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-10.png	refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-11.png	of the journey back to the place where every
data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-12.png	indication pointed to Eve being held.
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-00.png	&quot;As your employee it's not my business
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-01.png	to understand all the whys and
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-02.png	wherefores of your actions,&quot; he said
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-03.png	stiffly. &quot;Still less to criticise you.&quot;
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-04.png	&quot;Oh, drop that nonsense, Piers!
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-05.png	Be yourself,&quot; she exclaimed, with
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-06.png	mounting exasperation. &quot;Very well!&quot; He
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-07.png	brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-08.png	path fringed and shaded by citrus trees.
data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-09.png	&quot;If you want my true opinion I'll give it.
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-00.png	Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-01.png	to have been guests at yesterday's
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-02.png	celebrations, and their friendly welcome
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-03.png	and warm sympathy, as she explained
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-04.png	how she had come to miss the party,
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-05.png	made her send a complacent glance
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-06.png	in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-07.png	man was, she thought impatiently,
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-08.png	trying to worry her into the belief
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-09.png	that her failure to appear at a function
data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-10.png	on the estate was a major error:
data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-00.png	Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-01.png	white spray could be seen flying across the distance
data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-02.png	of a mile and a half, came the yawl under her full
data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-03.png	triangular sail, and to the judge's frightened eyes, so
data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-04.png	close to the rocks that it would be dashed
data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-05.png	against them with the lift of the next wave.
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-00.png	&quot;That boy! That damned fool boy! What does he mean
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-01.png	by trying to come home now, even if he did promise?
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-02.png	What does time mean when weighed against the life of
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-03.png	two human beings?&quot; Not until he was certain that the
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-04.png	yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-05.png	being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-06.png	empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-07.png	with part of that howling northwest gale.
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-00.png	With four doing the job and the waves
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-01.png	pushing at the stern, the yawl was soon
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-02.png	dragged out but before it was turned
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-03.png	over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-04.png	of water, tossed out a string of silvery
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-05.png	lake trout and said - 3&quot;Bill, he's better
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-06.png	man at catch 'em than Injun, Judge.
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-07.png	You look. Little one more as fifteen
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-08.png	inches. Maybe big one four feet,
data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-09.png	huh?&quot;
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-00.png	A submariner's wife needed to be spared as much
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-01.png	as possible. Anyway the Parsifal affair was far
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-02.png	too fresh in both their minds to be a comfortable
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-03.png	subject for discussion. &quot;It's a command,&quot; he said.
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-04.png	We can do with the extra money. It'll just about
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-05.png	pay Jacky's school fees.&quot; &quot;What shall we do
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-06.png	about this house? - and Jill's school? - and oh!
data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-07.png	how I hate the Navy!
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-00.png	If I'd known what it would be like I'd sooner
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-01.png	have married a parson.&quot; He kissed her. &quot;Parsons
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-02.png	work on Sundays,&quot; he said. &quot;They're worse off than
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-03.png	submariners. You ought to have married that fat
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-04.png	stockbroker chap and shared him with his three
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-05.png	mistresses. Anyway it might be much worse.
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-06.png	Pericles is a Portsmouth boat. She spends longer
data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-07.png	in harbour than any other submarine.
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-00.png	Practically a shore job. Cheer up.&quot; She wiped
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-01.png	her eyes and reached for her address book. &quot;I'll
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-02.png	write to those agents and try to get a flat in
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-03.png	Alverstoke,&quot; she said. &quot;But I don't know what
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-04.png	Jill will say about leaving her school. It's a
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-05.png	blessing that Jacky's off to boarding school.
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-06.png	And all the trouble you've taken with the
data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-07.png	garden!
data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-00.png	That little beast, Robbie Munyard!&quot; Having
data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-01.png	said her say Peggy manfully shouldered her
data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-02.png	burden and prepared to break up yet
data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-03.png	another home. In the ten years of married life
data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-04.png	this had already happened half a dozen times.
data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-05.png	Such is the life of a naval officer's wife.
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-00.png	John's father had been a naval officer of the old
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-01.png	school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-02.png	on to the second generation. One of these was that
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-03.png	an officer should join a ship, on taking up a
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-04.png	new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-05.png	in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-06.png	It would have been acceptable to all concerned
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-07.png	if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-08.png	plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-09.png	instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-10.png	sticking.
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-00.png	Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-01.png	of the church where there was a small open
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-02.png	outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-03.png	and forks and tidying up implements. It might
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-04.png	be open. It was. He entered, and seated himself
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-05.png	in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow.
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-06.png	His curious headgear fell off. Strange things
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-07.png	were going on in his bewildered brain. When
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-08.png	a man was drowning and towards his last
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-09.png	gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-10.png	life came up before him in some cinematic
data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-11.png	kind of sequence.
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-00.png	He didn't know what to make of it, but it
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-01.png	was Mr. Copthorne all right. Perhaps he had
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-02.png	been attending some kind of fancy dress do
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-03.png	in London. Very strange his eyes looked. Mad,
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-04.png	hunted eyes, as if the poor fellow had rocks in
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-05.png	his head, so the verger described afterwards.
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-06.png	&quot;You're very early about, sir,&quot; he said, trying to
data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-07.png	speak normally.
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-00.png	As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-01.png	and Simone go through the doorway that led
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-02.png	down to the beach. Gay closed her eyes for a
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-03.png	moment in disgust. She was fully aware that Gavin
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-04.png	would make love to the French girl on the sands,
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-05.png	and no doubt he would come back soon and
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-06.png	after Simone had left expect her to accept his
data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-07.png	kisses on the way back to the hotel.
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-00.png	Diana Wills often sat on the brand
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-01.png	new seat outside the hospital
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-02.png	gates and thought vagrant
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-03.png	thoughts. At one time she had
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-04.png	watched the workmen constructing
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-05.png	the roundabout, which was
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-06.png	to put St. John's Casualty Department
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-07.png	out of operation - in theory, at
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-08.png	least. She would think of her-
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-09.png	self as a stranger in these parts
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-10.png	studying these cross-roads. Which
data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-11.png	one to take?
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-00.png	&quot;If I were a tramp I would simply blow a
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-01.png	feather,&quot; she decided, rather envying the gentle-
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-02.png	man of the road his freedom of decision, and
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-03.png	wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-04.png	women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-05.png	airy directions accordingly. &quot;If I were needing a
data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-06.png	job I'd go to London, of course,&quot; she went on.
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-00.png	"Darling!" her voiced caressed him. "Moments like this
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-01.png	make all the waiting worth while. When we're
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-02.png	married we won't have these explosions of emotion,
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-03.png	will we?" "No," he eyed her strangely. "I wish we
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-04.png	were married, Di. Like a patient wishes his operation
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-05.png	was over." Again her laughter trilled. "Marriage
data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-06.png	isn't as bad as an operation, Nigel!"
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-00.png	Almost in desperation she appealed, &quot;Will you meet
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-01.png	me at the gate, four o'clock tomorrow?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; he
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-02.png	enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair. &quot;To bring
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-03.png	me up for tea, of course. I just thought.&quot; &quot;I'll see,&quot;
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-04.png	he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-05.png	which really hurt. &quot;Without your ring it's just like
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-06.png	kissing somebody else's girl,&quot; he decided wickedly,
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-07.png	and kissed her again, somewhat startled to
data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-08.png	receive a sharp slap for his pains.
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-00.png	Philip bristled. 'It was never our intention
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-01.png	to have one of those carnival affairs,' he
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-02.png	retorted and in that second, he became the man of
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-03.png	success exerting authority. Sandra watched her father's
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-04.png	face pale. Philip, she knew, got on his nerves, but
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-05.png	everything had gone over her head. It didn't really
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-06.png	matter what was being said because she was
data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-07.png	no longer a part of it.
data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-00.png	The thought of Nicholas haunted her, the sense of
data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-01.png	loss crucifying. Her father's comment roused her as
data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-02.png	he said, 'I was not talking of a carnival. But I
data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-03.png	presume we shall be allowed to have one or two
data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-04.png	of our friends at the ceremony.'
data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-00.png	Vence is a sober spot, half way between small
data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-01.png	town and village, pigeon grey, sly with arches, and
data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-02.png	linked by a whispering plot of fountains. In the main
data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-03.png	tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-04.png	sunshine, still burning like a half-cooled iron,
data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-05.png	sip pastis and read the local newspapers.
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-00.png	One called La Patriote is Communist, and at the time
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-01.png	of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-02.png	tomatoes at General de Gaulle. One side of this square
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-03.png	is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar. For one
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-04.png	day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-05.png	hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-06.png	elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest,
data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-07.png	had firmly closed the door in our noses.
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-00.png	'It is a pity,' said Mart, 'because it would have been
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-01.png	a good address.' Now, after a woman's radar look,
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-02.png	she decided Pierre would solve our problems. This
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-03.png	was true, Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al, thin and
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-04.png	yellow as lemon peel, wrestling with some gnawing rat
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-05.png	of an illness, man of all trades, married to a commanding
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-06.png	lady who loved small talk and the discreet
data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-07.png	accumulation of money.
data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-00.png	We went in. There were a few people in the bar,
data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-01.png	elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a hard
data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-02.png	bargain for giving up. 'I have furnished rooms,' said
data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-03.png	Pierre, 'and all mod cons.' The price was 16,000 francs a
data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-04.png	month. 'Yes,' we said immediately, even before viewing.
data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-05.png	We were shown around by Pierre.
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-00.png	The flat was on the third floor; two rooms; soft Provenc*?
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-01.png	6al view; good intimate furnishing and colour; running
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-02.png	hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up,
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-03.png	basin and bidet; own private, modern lavatory. The
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-04.png	first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence.
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-05.png	We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-06.png	eruption of turtle-doves.
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-00.png	This was strange, even magic, because the owner's
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-01.png	name was Pierre Tortorolo which, in Nicoison Italian means
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-02.png	'turtledove'. Pierre Turtledove. When we woke up properly it
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-03.png	was raining, an even more hopeless rain than London, and we
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-04.png	looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-05.png	curling white breath of the mountains. The land looked
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-06.png	like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-07.png	shame.
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-00.png	There they were, in fact, below us, eight of them.
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-01.png	Four of them were flattened on the window sills, two
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-02.png	immolated on a nearby roof top, the other pair copulating.
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-03.png	We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people.
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-04.png	Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-05.png	Lawrence. He was here, near the railway station, three or
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-06.png	four years. During this period he wrote a book,
data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-07.png	The Lover of Lady Chatterly.
data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-00.png	In the train going back to London I sat
data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-01.png	beside # Catherine. She had the stories open
data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-02.png	in front of her, but she said: 'Philip's awfully lucky.
data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-03.png	I wish I went to that school. Did you notice
data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-04.png	that girl who said hullo to him in the garden?
data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-00.png	He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-01.png	provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-02.png	to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also
data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-03.png	postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-04.png	was ended, audited and agreed by the Inspector. The
data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-05.png	process could, and often did take several years.
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-00.png	The train drew into another station
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-01.png	and Cecil, with a further six stops
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-02.png	to go, was left almost alone in the
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-03.png	coach. He fumed as he recol-
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-04.png	lected the long correspondence he
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-05.png	had had with the Inland Reve-
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-06.png	nue in an effort to obtain
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-07.png	tax relief for a jacket used
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-08.png	solely in the office. 'If the jacket
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-09.png	is a condition of your employment,'
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-10.png	the Inspector had written, 'it may
data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-11.png	qualify for relief.'
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-00.png	Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-01.png	printing to find no Govr., no Compa., in fact no five pound notes
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-02.png	at all. He was holding a paper booklet, the top sheet of which
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-03.png	bore, in large Baskerville type, the words METROPOLITAN
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-04.png	MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-05.png	COURSE NO. 3. He ruffled the sheets irritably and
data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-06.png	glowered at his own breach of social morality.
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-00.png	The next thing that Serena discovered was that
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-01.png	she could not afford to buy a house at all.
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-02.png	And this in spite of having at last managed
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-03.png	to save the ten percent needed. Or so she
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-04.png	thought, being then in possession of what
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-05.png	seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-
data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-06.png	red pounds. The lawyer said:
data/r03/r03-115/r03-115-00.png	Much more spacious than that poky little cottage,
data/r03/r03-115/r03-115-01.png	which wasn't a bit practical really, the
data/r03/r03-115/r03-115-02.png	reception room was too small when divided
data/r03/r03-115/r03-115-03.png	and too big when not.
