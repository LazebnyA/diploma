data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-00.png	A MOVE to stop Mr. Gaitskell from
data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-01.png	nominating any more Labour life Peers
data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-02.png	is to be made at a meeting of Labour
data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-03.png	M Ps tomorrow. Mr. Michael Foot has
data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-04.png	put down a resolution on the subject
data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-05.png	and he is to be backed by Mr. Will
data/a01/a01-000u/a01-000u-06.png	Griffiths, M P for Manchester Exchange.
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-00.png	Though they may gather some Left-wing
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-01.png	support, a large majority of Labour
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-02.png	M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-

data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-04.png	be that as Labour M Ps opposed the
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-05.png	Government Bill which brought life peers
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-06.png	into existence, they should not now put
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-07.png	forward nominees. He believes that the
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-08.png	House of Lords should be abolished and
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-09.png	that Labour should not take any steps
data/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-10.png	which would appear to &quot;prop up&quot; an out-
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-00.png	Since 1958, 13 Labour life Peers and
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-01.png	Peeresses have been created. Most Labour
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-02.png	sentiment would still favour the abolition
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-03.png	of the House of Lords, but while it remains
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-04.png	Labour has to have an adequate number
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-05.png	of members. THE two rival African

data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-08.png	the challenge from Sir Roy Welensky,
data/a01/a01-007u/a01-007u-09.png	the Federal Premier.

data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-03.png	African National Congress (400,000) will
data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-04.png	meet in London today to discuss a common
data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-05.png	course of action. Sir Roy is violently
data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-06.png	opposed to Africans getting an elected
data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-07.png	majority in Northern Rhodesia, but the
data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-08.png	Colonial Secretary, Mr. Iain Macleod,
data/a01/a01-011u/a01-011u-09.png	is insisting on a policy of change.
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-00.png	Sir Roy's United Federal Party is
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-01.png	boycotting the London talks on the
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-02.png	Protectorate's future. Said Mr. Nkumbula
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-03.png	last night: &quot;We want to discuss what to
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-04.png	do if the British demonstrations.&quot;
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-05.png	Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide, Mr.
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-06.png	Julius Greenfield, telephoned his chief
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-07.png	a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan
data/a01/a01-014u/a01-014u-08.png	at Chequers.
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-00.png	Mr. Macleod went on with the conference
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-01.png	at Lancaster House despite the crisis
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-02.png	which had blown up. He has now revealed
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-03.png	his full plans to the Africans and Liberals
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-04.png	attending. These plans do not give the
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-05.png	Africans the overall majority they are
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-06.png	seeking. African delegates are studying
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-07.png	them today. The conference will meet
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-08.png	to discuss the function of a proposed
data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-09.png	House of Chiefs.
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-00.png	MR. IAIN MACLEOD, the Colonial Secretary,
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-01.png	denied in the Commons last night that
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-02.png	there have been secret negotiations on
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-03.png	Northern Rhodesia's future. The Northern
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-04.png	Rhodesia conference in London has been
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-05.png	boycotted by the two main settlers' parties -
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-06.png	the United Federal Party and the Dominion
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-07.png	Party. But representatives of Sir Roy
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-08.png	Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-09.png	African Federation, went to Chequers at
data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-10.png	the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-00.png	Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation.
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-01.png	Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-02.png	meeting. But he told M Ps yesterday: &quot;I
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-03.png	have no knowledge of secret negotiations.&quot;
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-04.png	He said Britain had an obligation to consult
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-05.png	the Federal Government. But the final
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-06.png	decision remained with the British Government.
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-07.png	Mr. James Callaghan, Labour's Colonial
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-08.png	spokesman, said Sir Roy had no right to
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-09.png	delay progress in the talks by refusing
data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-10.png	to sit round the conference table.
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-00.png	Informal talks at Lancaster House will
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-01.png	resume today. PRESIDENT KENNEDY today
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-02.png	defended the appointment of a Negro as
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-03.png	his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-04.png	opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-05.png	Deep South. The negro is Mr. Robert #
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-06.png	Weaver of New York. One of his tasks will
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-07.png	be to see there is no racial discrimination
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-08.png	in Government and State housing
data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-09.png	projects.
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-00.png	Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana,
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-01.png	sparked off the opposition by telling a
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-02.png	television audience it was &quot;current
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-03.png	Washington gossip&quot; that Weaver once had
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-04.png	Communist affiliations. The Senate Banking
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-05.png	Committee, which is headed by another
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-06.png	Southern Senator - Willis Robertson, of
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-07.png	Virginia - met today in closed session to
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-08.png	discuss Weaver's appointment. Senator
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-09.png	Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter
data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-10.png	to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-00.png	Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana,
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-01.png	sparked off the opposition by telling a

data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-03.png	gossip&quot; that Weaver once had Communist affilia-
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-04.png	tions. The Senate Banking Committee, which
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-05.png	is headed by another Southern Senator -
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-06.png	Willis Robertson, of Virginia - met today in
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-07.png	closed session to discuss Weaver's appointment.
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-08.png	Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-09.png	letter to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-10.png	complaints about Weaver's loyalty.
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-00.png	He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-01.png	alleged association with organisations black-
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-02.png	listed by the Government. Immediately Mr.
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-03.png	Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-04.png	saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-05.png	reported on Mr. Weaver. He believed
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-06.png	he would perform &quot;outstanding service&quot;
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-07.png	in his post. Senator Robertson's committee
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-08.png	has to pass Mr. Weaver's nomination before it
data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-09.png	can be considered by the full Senate.
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-00.png	PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-01.png	over West Germany's cash offer to help
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-02.png	America's balance of payments position. He
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-03.png	said bluntly in Washington yesterday that
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-04.png	the offer - 357million - was not good enough.
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-05.png	And he indicated that his Government
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-06.png	would try to get Germany to pay more. He
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-07.png	did not mention personal talks with Dr.
data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-08.png	Adenauer, the West German Chancellor.
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-00.png	But he said discussions &quot;on a higher
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-01.png	level than in the past&quot; might be useful.
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-02.png	The President will probably discuss the
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-03.png	problem with Dr. Brentano, the West German
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-04.png	Foreign Minister, who is due in Washington
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-05.png	next week. A big slice of Germany's &quot;aid&quot;
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-06.png	is the early payment of a 210million
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-07.png	debt to America. United States officials
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-08.png	quickly point out that this is money due
data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-09.png	to America anyway.
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-00.png	And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-01.png	that they cannot pay more than 357million
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-02.png	without upsetting their own economy. The
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-03.png	Americans say Germany is having it too
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-04.png	good and is not paying for the past
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-05.png	or for the present. The Adenauer Government
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-06.png	flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-07.png	Government to get them to pay a regular
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-08.png	sum towards the cost of keeping American
data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-09.png	troops in Germany.
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-00.png	These support costs are a big drain on
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-01.png	America's dollar reserves. Dr. Adenauer's
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-02.png	answer is the once-and-for-all cash
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-03.png	offer of 357 million. President Kennedy's
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-04.png	rejection of it is a painful blow to the
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-05.png	West German Government. It will now have
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-06.png	to pay more - and increase taxation to do
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-07.png	so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting
data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-08.png	the new American administration.
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-00.png	And, since this is election year in West
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-01.png	Germany, Dr. Adenauer is in a tough spot.
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-02.png	Joyce Egginton cables: President Kennedy
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-03.png	at his Washington Press conference admitted
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-04.png	he did not know whether America was
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-05.png	lagging behind Russia in missile power.
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-06.png	He said he was waiting for his senior
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-07.png	military aides to come up with the answer
data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-08.png	on February 20.
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-00.png	This surprising statement was a sharp about-
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-01.png	face from his warnings during the
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-02.png	Presidential election campaign. He claimed
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-03.png	slackness in the Eisenhower Administration
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-04.png	had caused America to lag behind Russia
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-05.png	in nuclear development. President Kennedy
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-06.png	did his best to avoid giving Pressmen
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-07.png	a direct answer. George Brown
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-08.png	CHILDREN TWO men who are poles apart
data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-09.png	in personality last night dominated
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-00.png	Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted,
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-01.png	led Labour's attack on the higher health
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-02.png	charges. Mr. Powell, white-faced and
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-03.png	outwardly unemotional, replied with a
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-04.png	statistical statement - and ended by inciting
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-05.png	Labour M Ps to angry uproar. One dealt
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-06.png	with the human issue behind the Health
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-07.png	Service; the other tried to show that the
data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-08.png	balance-sheet must always come first.
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-00.png	The result of the vote was not in doubt.
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-01.png	For the Tories were massed in answer to
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-02.png	their whips to defeat a censure motion
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-03.png	on the Government for &quot;undermining the
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-04.png	Health Service&quot; and placing heavy burdens
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-05.png	on those least able to bear them. Mr.
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-06.png	Brown declared that the policy under
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-07.png	censure was monstrous. It had offended
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-08.png	many people far beyond the ranks of
data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-09.png	Labour supporters.
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-00.png	The Press, many doctors and public were
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-01.png	denouncing the proposals. He quoted from
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-02.png	this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received:

data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-06.png	Conservative. I am horrified and amazed
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-07.png	by my party's proposal to prostitute the
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-08.png	whole principle of the State service and
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-09.png	to render that service a hardship to poor
data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-10.png	people.
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-00.png	&quot;After a lifetime of helping others and
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-01.png	healing the sick, my considered opinion is that
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-02.png	anybody supporting the increased charges is a
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-03.png	wicked, old -.&quot; Mr. Brown went on: &quot;We
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-04.png	are dealing with a noble edifice which
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-05.png	needs an imaginative architect to improve
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-06.png	it, but it has got a quantity surveyor. We
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-07.png	have descended from the real problems to
data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-08.png	fiddling about with bills of cost.
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-00.png	&quot;We believe that a comprehensive medical
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-01.png	service, free to the patient at the point
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-02.png	of need and with one standard for all
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-03.png	sick people, is good and attainable.
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-04.png	&quot;We remain for it. But the Tories
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-05.png	never were.&quot; Interrupted by angry Tories,
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-06.png	Mr. Brown retorted: &quot;The jackals bay
data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-07.png	when there is nothing better they can do.&quot;
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-00.png	He told them that their conception of social
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-01.png	services was wholly different - fundamentally
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-02.png	different from that of Labour. They would
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-03.png	provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-04.png	wretched - but it would not be too comfortable
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-05.png	nor too easy to get. Answering jeers that
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-06.png	it was Labour which first put a ceiling
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-07.png	on health spending and started charges, Mr.
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-08.png	Brown reminded the hostile Government benches
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-09.png	that was done in 1950 because of the financial
data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-10.png	strain of the Korean war.
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-00.png	In fact, the Tories made it worse now
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-01.png	for the sick and needy than Labour had
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-02.png	to make it in 1950. And as a percentage
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-03.png	of social service expenditure, health had
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-04.png	fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-05.png	Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-06.png	the unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-07.png	that instead of taking it out of the
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-08.png	patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-09.png	action against the drug making industry, #
data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-10.png	whose profits had risen by up to 400 per
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-00.png	&quot;Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-01.png	of mothers, children and sick people than
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-02.png	to take on this vast industry,&quot; Mr.
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-03.png	Brown commented icily. &quot;Let us have a
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-04.png	full inquiry into the cost of drugs and
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-05.png	the pharmaceutical industry.&quot; The health
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-06.png	of children today owed much to the welfare
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-07.png	food scheme. It was maintained during
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-08.png	the war. Now in conditions of Tory
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-09.png	affluence it seemed it could not be
data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-10.png	carried on.
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-00.png	When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-01.png	cheered for a full minute - and even his
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-02.png	bitterest opponents on defence joined in.
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-03.png	Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-04.png	details of plans for improving the hospital
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-05.png	service, on which indeed the Government is
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-06.png	making progress. His basic defence of the
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-07.png	Health Service cuts was that &quot;even after
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-08.png	the proposed changes the net cost of the
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-09.png	service to the Exchequer will have increased
data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-10.png	over three years by 20 per cent.
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-00.png	&quot;That cannot continue without either development
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-01.png	being limited or an adjustment being made
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-02.png	in financing.&quot; The Government decided to
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-03.png	adjust the financing - which Mr. Powell
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-04.png	claimed was underpinning - not undermining -
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-05.png	the service. Answering the attack on
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-06.png	&quot;economic charges&quot; for welfare foods, Mr.
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-07.png	Powell said that all these foods would
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-08.png	still be free in families receiving regular
data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-09.png	National Assistance grants.
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-00.png	&quot;That cannot continue without either development
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-01.png	being limited or an adjustment being made
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-02.png	in financing.&quot; The Government decided to adjust
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-03.png	the financing - which Mr. Powell claimed was
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-04.png	underpinning - not undermining - the service.
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-05.png	Answering the attack on &quot;economic charges&quot;
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-06.png	for welfare, Mr. Powell said that all these
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-07.png	foods would still be free in families receiving
data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-08.png	regular National Assistance grants.
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-00.png	On the other hand, Mr. Pearson excels
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-01.png	in meeting people informally, but many
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-02.png	still regard him &quot;as some sort of cross
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-03.png	between an egghead and a missionary&quot;.
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-04.png	His party advisers are now trying to
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-05.png	correct that image. The bow tie has
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-06.png	gone; he is having lessons on
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-07.png	television techniques and is being coached
data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-08.png	by speech experts.
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-00.png	But, at the same time, there is reason to
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-01.png	believe that the Federal Government is not
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-02.png	convinced, on the basis of the information
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-03.png	it has so far, that such a project would
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-04.png	be justified from a scientific point of view;
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-05.png	and not merely constitute a &quot;prestige&quot;
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-06.png	satellite, duplicating to some extent American
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-07.png	efforts, as Die Welt suggests today in
data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-08.png	a highly critical editorial article.
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-00.png	On the specific question of the use of Blue
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-01.png	Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-02.png	easier. He can point out that this is the
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-03.png	only rocket and launcher in Europe to
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-04.png	have reached a sufficient stage of development
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-05.png	for adaptation as the first stage in
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-06.png	putting a heavy satellite into outer space.
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-07.png	There has also been some talk of adopting another
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-08.png	British rocket, Black Knight, for the second
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-09.png	stage, but the French have one of their
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-10.png	own called Veronique which they would
data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-11.png	like to see used.
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-00.png	The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-01.png	today, however, that the Brussels Treaty
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-02.png	was irrelevant, because research on the
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-03.png	various rocket stages had already been
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-04.png	concluded, and only cooperation on the type
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-05.png	of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-06.png	to German participation is the absence of
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-07.png	any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-08.png	for it - and therefore of any budget
data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-09.png	under which funds could be appropriated.
data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-00.png	This is expected eventually to replace the
data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-01.png	Fiat G-91, and the F 104 Starfighter,
data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-02.png	the backbone of the German Air
data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-03.png	Force.
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-00.png	THE next White Paper on defence, to
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-01.png	be published in March, is likely to
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-02.png	contain a five-year plan for the three
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-03.png	Services. Its aim will be to produce superbly
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-04.png	equipped, all-Regular forces of
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-05.png	about 400,000 men. The three Services
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-06.png	would be &quot;integrated&quot; to a greater
data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-07.png	extent than ever before.
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-00.png	The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-01.png	approval. Mr. Watkinson remains con-
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-02.png	vinced that the policy initiated in
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-03.png	1957, in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-04.png	of Defence, is still correct. This was to
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-05.png	return to the tradition of all-Regular
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-06.png	voluntary forces, with the last National
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-07.png	Serviceman out of uniform by the end
data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-08.png	of 1962.
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-00.png	The Minister regards the recent trend
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-01.png	of recruiting figures as encouraging.
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-02.png	He is confident the aim can be achieved.
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-03.png	While the possibility of an eventual return
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-04.png	to National Service in some form
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-05.png	cannot be entirely discounted, he does
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-06.png	not agree that the point has been reached
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-07.png	where this need even be considered. If
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-08.png	National Service is ever resorted to,
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-09.png	engagement would probably have to be for
data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-10.png	three years.
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-00.png	It is thought this would be the minimum
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-01.png	necessary for the extended training modern
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-02.png	arms require and to enable each man to
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-03.png	serve at least a year overseas. There is
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-04.png	no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-05.png	is at odds with the Service chiefs over
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-06.png	the decision to dispense with National
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-07.png	Service, or over any other aspect of
data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-08.png	defence policy.
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-00.png	Criticisms about Army manpower appear
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-01.png	to have come mainly from retired officers
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-02.png	who have held high positions but
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-03.png	are out of touch with the existing situation.
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-04.png	Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-05.png	from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-06.png	Francis Festing, who believes completely
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-07.png	in the principle of an all-Regular army.
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-08.png	Gen. Sir Richard Hull, who is to succeed
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-09.png	Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr.
data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-10.png	Watkinson is right.
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-00.png	Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-01.png	as from Nov. 1. The hand-over, due in
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-02.png	September, was delayed because of the
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-03.png	Berlin crisis. Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-04.png	felt the change would be unwise at a
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-05.png	moment # when attention had to be
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-06.png	concentrated on possible need for important
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-07.png	military operations. For this reason Sir
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-08.png	Francis stayed on, and # sacrificed
data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-09.png	his leave.
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-00.png	There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-01.png	towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd,
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-02.png	the Prime Minister. This implies the dis-
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-03.png	appearance of the Progressive party from
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-04.png	the House. Early results in yesterday's
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-05.png	general election showed Nationalists being
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-06.png	returned in their strongholds, like Bloem-
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-07.png	fontein and the Transvaal, with slightly
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-08.png	increased majorities. In the Cape, the
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-09.png	veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry
data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-10.png	Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-00.png	The defeat of the leader of the
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-01.png	Progressive party, Dr. Steytler, in Port
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-02.png	Elizabeth South, announced immediately
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-03.png	afterwards by the United party candidate,
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-04.png	Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives deprived
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-05.png	of both their chief figures. Dr. Verwoerd and
data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-06.png	the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de

data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-10.png	dates are unopposed.
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-00.png	Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-01.png	evident that voters were bored by the
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-02.png	Government's frequent appeals to the electorate.
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-03.png	The election was the fourth in four years.
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-04.png	In most constituencies it may go down as
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-05.png	the most apathetic in the country's history.
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-06.png	THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-07.png	last night that he had considered early
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-08.png	in the Parliamentary recess whether to
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-09.png	mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-10.png	British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing.
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-00.png	He decided that it would be a great error
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-01.png	to do so and to recall Parliament. But
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-02.png	there would be no hesitation in mobilising
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-03.png	if a further deterioration in the situation
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-04.png	warranted such a step. It would have to be
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-05.png	accompanied by other measures of a military,
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-06.png	economic and political kind. Mr. Macmillan,
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-07.png	who was winding up the foreign affairs
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-08.png	debate, said the Government could not
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-09.png	be party to accepting as a matter of
data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-10.png	principle the imposed division of Germany.
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-00.png	&quot;We must not be rattled into surrender,
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-01.png	but we must not - and I am not - be
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-02.png	afraid of negotiation.&quot; Mr. Godber,
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-03.png	Minister of State, Foreign Office, said
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-04.png	earlier that the Government had asked
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-05.png	the Medical Research Council to reassess
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-06.png	the fall-out position in view of the Russian
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-07.png	tests. The Council's findings would be
data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-08.png	made public.
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-00.png	With a vigour and authority which delighted
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-01.png	old Parliamentary friends and foes alike,
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-02.png	the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-03.png	Eden, in his maiden speech in the House
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-04.png	of Lords last night, gave a warning
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-05.png	that # appeasement over Berlin could
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-06.png	only lead to war. To stand firm, he
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-07.png	declared, was not to invite war, but
data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-08.png	the surest way to avert it.
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-00.png	It was the end of a rather curious
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-01.png	speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-02.png	the two-day debate on foreign affairs.
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-03.png	He began in a low, almost chatty mono-
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-04.png	tone, and his voice never rose to any
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-05.png	accent of urgency. He passed in rapid
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-06.png	review the United Nations Secretariat;
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-07.png	nuclear tests; the canard about British
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-08.png	interference with the United Nations
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-09.png	in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East
data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-10.png	Asia.
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-00.png	He spent most of his short half-hour on
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-01.png	Berlin. He deplored the possibility of
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-02.png	some &quot;new myth&quot; about betrayal of Germany
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-03.png	by the Allies. &quot;We do not,&quot; he said, &quot;really
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-04.png	know what the Russians want.&quot; But he was
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-05.png	certain that they wanted to establish a
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-06.png	final and irrevocable division of Germany.
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-07.png	Britain could not be a party to an imposed
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-08.png	division. But negotiation, as the debate had
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-09.png	shown, could be undertaken on a variety
data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-10.png	of bases.
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-00.png	Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-01.png	ately refrained during the summer from
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-02.png	recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-03.png	by proclamation, such as would be
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-04.png	necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-05.png	on to a fully active footing. That
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-06.png	would have created a thoroughly unde-
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-07.png	sirable atmosphere of panic. He thought
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-08.png	that the situation was rather more
data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-09.png	hopeful.
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-00.png	The Russians now realised its seriousness. The
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-01.png	French doubts were more about procedure
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-02.png	than about substance. The Prime Minister's
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-03.png	attitude of studied calm brought down the
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-04.png	temperature of the debate, which never
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-05.png	at any time rose to fever pitch, to a
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-06.png	remarkable degree of sub-normality.
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-07.png	Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-08.png	of Home, Foreign Secretary, was listening
data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-09.png	in the Peers' Gallery.
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-00.png	The early speakers in the debate each
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-01.png	severely rated the speech of his predecessor.
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-02.png	These strictures were all too well justified.
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-03.png	We started with the plaintive wailings
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-04.png	of Mr. Healey, &quot;Shadow&quot; Foreign Secretary,
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-05.png	described by Mr. Godber, Minister of
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-06.png	State, Foreign Office, as &quot;pedantic and
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-07.png	obscure on Berlin, damaging and obscure
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-08.png	on the Congo.&quot; In turn, Mr. Godber was
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-09.png	censured by Mr. Shinwell, former Labour
data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-10.png	Defence Minister, for having read the
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-00.png	The trouble about such debates is that
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-01.png	they range too widely. They remind one of
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-02.png	the Rugby match in &quot;Tom Brown's Schooldays,&quot;
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-03.png	in which all the boys were welcome to
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-04.png	take part, and only those who &quot;really meant
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-05.png	business&quot; removed their jackets. Not many
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-06.png	metaphorical braces were visible in the
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-07.png	early stages of to-night's debate. Mr.
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-08.png	Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-09.png	golf-course Press conference, which he
data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-10.png	described as &quot;a display of flabby and
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-00.png	A reference to the reunification of Germany
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-01.png	brought a bark of &quot;Start another war!&quot;
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-02.png	from Mr. Ellis Smith (Lab., Stoke on Trent S.).
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-03.png	Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-04.png	theme of limitation of armaments in Europe.
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-05.png	This could, he suggested, be linked with
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-06.png	prohibition of the production of atomic
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-07.png	weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-08.png	and control would be much easier to
data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-09.png	establish in these territories.
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-00.png	Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-01.png	using double standards. Ministers had
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-02.png	rebuked the unaligned nations for not
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-03.png	condemning the new Russian tests, but
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-04.png	they themselves had no condemnation for
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-05.png	events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-06.png	the Government, said Mr. Healey, to
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-07.png	take up moral attitudes, &quot;especially when
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-08.png	the temple of their religion is the
data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-09.png	bingo-parlour.&quot;
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-00.png	This puzzled such students of comparative
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-01.png	religion as had failed to detect this cult.
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-02.png	But Mr. Healey had a partial and
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-03.png	limited success. He rallied behind him
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-04.png	the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-05.png	night by his leader, Mr. Gaitskell. Mr.
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-06.png	Godber's performance merited all the mild
data/a05/a05-108/a05-108-07.png	scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell.
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-00.png	True, he did tell the House that the
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-01.png	Government had asked the Medical Research
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-02.png	Council to reassess the fall-out position in
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-03.png	view of the Russian tests, and said that
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-04.png	the council's findings would be published.
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-05.png	He was not so happy in his defence of
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-06.png	the Government's failure to condemn
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-07.png	France for her nuclear tests in the
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-08.png	Sahara on the grounds that they were
data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-09.png	only little ones.
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-00.png	This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-01.png	and her illegitimate baby. For the most
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-02.png	part, Mr. Godber muttered his way
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-03.png	through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-04.png	brief. He resembles the elephant seal, an
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-05.png	# otherwise endearing creature whose
data/a05/a05-116/a05-116-06.png	articulation is limited, we are told, to a

data/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-03.png	Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the
data/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-04.png	West German Government. It will now have to pay
data/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-05.png	more - and increase taxation to do so - or
data/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-06.png	run the obvious risks in upsetting the new

data/a01/a01-030x/a01-030x-06.png	Labour's Colonial spokesman, said Sir Roy had

data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-01.png	needy than Labour had to make it in 1950. And
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-02.png	as a percentage of social service expenditure,
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-03.png	health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-04.png	Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-05.png	unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded that instead
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-06.png	of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-07.png	take ruthless action against the drug making
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-08.png	industry, whose profits had risen by up to 400
data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-09.png	per cent. in the last eight years.
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-00.png	&quot;Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out of mothers,
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-01.png	children and sick people than to take on this vast
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-02.png	industry,&quot; Mr. Brown commented icily. &quot;Let us have a
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-03.png	full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the pharmaceutical
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-04.png	industry.&quot; The health of children today owed much
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-05.png	to the welfare food scheme. It was maintained
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-06.png	during the war. Now in conditions of Tory
data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-07.png	affluence it seemed it could not be carried on.
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-00.png	When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-01.png	a full minute - and even his bitterest opponents
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-02.png	on defence joined in. Mr. Powell devoted half his speech
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-03.png	to giving details of plans for improving the hospital service,
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-04.png	on which indeed the Government is making progress.
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-05.png	His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-06.png	&quot;even after the proposed changes the net cost of the
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-07.png	service to the Exchequer will have increased over
data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-08.png	three years by 20 per cent.
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-00.png	&quot;That cannot continue without either
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-01.png	development being limited or an
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-02.png	adjustment being made in financing.&quot;
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-03.png	The Government decided to adjust
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-04.png	the financing - which Mr. Powell
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-05.png	claimed was underpinning - not
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-06.png	undermining - the service. Answering the
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-07.png	attack on &quot;economic charges&quot; for welfare
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-08.png	foods, Mr. Powell said that all these
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-09.png	foods would still be free in families
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-10.png	receiving regular National Assistance
data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-11.png	grants.
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-00.png	So the idea of personal mission by
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-01.png	the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-02.png	Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-03.png	hand-picked team under the leadership of
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-04.png	Sir Pierson Dixon, Britain's Ambassador to
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-05.png	France, to back Mr. Edward Heath, Lord
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-06.png	Privy Seal, who is charged with the conduct
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-07.png	of negotiations with the Six. At the same
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-08.png	time the Prime Minister has offered
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-09.png	Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to
data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-10.png	safeguard their interests
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-00.png	The urge came from a conference of activists of
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-01.png	Nkrumah's Convention Party &quot;after powerful addresses
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-02.png	by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio,&quot; and
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-03.png	others. Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-04.png	a &quot;limited state of emergency&quot; was declared, giving
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-05.png	the Government adequate power to maintain all
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-06.png	essential services and ensure food supplies. Thus it
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-07.png	becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-08.png	for anyone who &quot;publishes a report likely to cause
data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-09.png	alarm or prejudicial to public safety.&quot;
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-00.png	And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-01.png	on anyone convicted of sabotage. These stern measures
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-02.png	had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-03.png	strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre,
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-04.png	they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-05.png	police and 16 armoured cars. And how did the
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-06.png	Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-07.png	Accra?
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-00.png	&quot;It is true he made a point of again being absent
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-01.png	from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-02.png	indulged in such violence.&quot; But Sir Roy pointed out
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-03.png	that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-04.png	if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-05.png	would make the Mau Mau in Kenya &quot;seem like a
data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-06.png	child's picnic.&quot;
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-00.png	JOHN DICKIE writes: Mr. Macmillan gave top
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-01.png	priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-02.png	return from Scotland yesterday. He summoned Mr.
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-03.png	Iain Macleod, Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Duncan Sandys,
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-04.png	Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-05.png	at Admiralty House. A statement is expected today
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-06.png	to hold the door open for modifications to the
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-07.png	new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
data/a02/a02-093/a02-093-08.png	in Northern Rhodesia.
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-00.png	Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-01.png	problem. Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-02.png	strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-03.png	suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-04.png	African nationalists. Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-05.png	from talks with Sir John Moffat, Northern Rhodesian
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-06.png	Liberal leader, and Mr. Kaunda, that the bulk
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-07.png	of moderates and Africans will reject the
data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-08.png	Constitution unless it is modified.
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-00.png	If the threatened &quot;counter-revolution&quot; was not * to bring
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-01.png	the President back from his travels it might have been
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-02.png	thought that the muster from the 13 States of the
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-03.png	Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence.
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-04.png	After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-05.png	year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-06.png	in Accra.
data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-07.png	* enough
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-00.png	It has been left, however, to Mr. Goka, Ghana's Finance
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-01.png	Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-02.png	he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-03.png	Hotel. POLICE, on direct orders from the Cabinet, are
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-04.png	openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-05.png	disarming Committee of 100, the Committee claimed
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-06.png	yesterday. It said pressure was being put on
data/a02/a02-053/a02-053-07.png	members and associates all over the country.
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-00.png	&quot;He is not going to agree to be bound over. That will
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-01.png	probably mean jail and, though frail, he is very fit and
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-02.png	will take the rigours of prison in his stride. He
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-03.png	hopes to be allowed to do some writing.&quot; Back at
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-04.png	the Press conference, Mr. Clark said two committee
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-05.png	members tried a &quot;plant&quot; call on suspect phone. They
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-06.png	discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-07.png	was planned but police turned up.
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-00.png	He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-01.png	had been arrested or convicted since last year on
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-02.png	charges of creating disturbances. During the first
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-03.png	three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-04.png	had been reported in Northern Rhodesia. More
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-05.png	than 500 people - 167 of them members of
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-06.png	the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-07.png	Northern Province alone.
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-00.png	&quot;Against this background must be taken Mr.
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-01.png	Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-02.png	doing is in the name of non-violence,&quot; said
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-03.png	Sir Roy. &quot;I am now compelled to say that
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-04.png	I don't accept his good faith.&quot; He said
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-05.png	Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-06.png	had stimulated violence, but he had done
data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-07.png	nothing to stop it.
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-00.png	A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-01.png	Buganda (King Freddie) from Princess
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-02.png	Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro, kneeling at the
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-03.png	foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-04.png	yesterday. Forty other Africans greeted him,
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-05.png	kneeling with heads bowed. The princess,
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-06.png	aged 24, is now studying history at Cambri-
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-07.png	dge, where she is a friend of Prince William
data/a02/a02-102/a02-102-08.png	of Gloucester.
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-00.png	King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-01.png	native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-02.png	Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod, before the
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-03.png	Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday.
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-04.png	The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-05.png	The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-06.png	to settle the relationships between them and the
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-07.png	rest of the country. A Government report has
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-08.png	recognised their rights and recommended a form of
data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-09.png	federal association, but the four kings are not
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-00.png	Instead, the kings will remain in London
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-01.png	and wait to hear the conference's proposals.
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-02.png	Then their views will be transmitted back.
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-03.png	MR. BUTLER, the Home Secretary, has decided
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-04.png	to meet head-on the biggest challenge to
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-05.png	Government authority yet presented by the
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-06.png	&quot;Ban-the-Bomb&quot; demonstrators. Police leave
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-07.png	has been cancelled and secret plans prepared
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-08.png	to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-09.png	for Sunday in Parliament-square by the
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-10.png	Committee of 100, the anti-nuclear arms
data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-11.png	group.
data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-00.png	Measures agreed so far include: 1. A mass
data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-01.png	call-out of police, special constables
data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-02.png	and reserves, with 750 policemen posted
data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-03.png	from outlying districts to stations in
data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-04.png	the area - West End Central, Bow-street,
data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-05.png	and Cannon-row.
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-00.png	It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-01.png	in the role of a popular orator at the
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-02.png	hustings, the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-03.png	baker was in the last two campaigns. The
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-04.png	impression remains that the Liberal leader
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-05.png	is still the diplomatist, more at home
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-06.png	in the chancery, or the corridors of the United
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-07.png	Nations, not the father figure, so necessary
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-08.png	in Canadian leadership, or the practical
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-09.png	politician, able to talk about sewage problems
data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-10.png	in Algoma East.
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-00.png	It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-01.png	ended yesterday in 32 members of the
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-02.png	Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-03.png	a breach of the peace. The committee's
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-04.png	president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-05.png	his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-06.png	a week. Playwrights Arnold Wesker (The Kitchen)
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-07.png	and Robert Bolt (The Flowering Cherry) were
data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-08.png	jailed for a month.
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-00.png	Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of Indo-
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-01.png	nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-02.png	Foreign Minister. In fact such Yugoslav activity has
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-03.png	been # particularly intensified in the past year
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-04.png	or so and though so far, apart from joint action
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-05.png	in the United Nations, these exchanges have not
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-06.png	been seen on any wider basis, President Tito
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-07.png	is known for some time to have favoured a
data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-08.png	conference of neutralist leaders.
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-00.png	The wish was particularly apparent in comments
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-01.png	on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and,
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-02.png	in particular, in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-03.png	inter-African consultative assembly which would
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-04.png	coordinate activity on the political and economic
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-05.png	sphere; and it is not difficult to see that President
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-06.png	Tito would like some such idea extended also
data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-07.png	to the whole uncommitted world

data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-01.png	situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-02.png	the new and independent countries of Africa, that the
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-03.png	time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-04.png	the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-05.png	stands on various problems facing those nations. Two
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-06.png	subjects, the Congo and Algeria, are the main topics
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-07.png	of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-08.png	leaders have identical ideas.
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-00.png	Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-01.png	the mission, but recent statements made by him
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-02.png	in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-03.png	himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-04.png	Laos. His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-05.png	to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace, though
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-06.png	at the cost of virtual partition of the country
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-07.png	into the pro-communist north and the
data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-08.png	pro-western centre and south.
data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-00.png	Prince Souvanna's former Minister of
data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-01.png	Information, Mr. Quinim Pholsena, who

data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-10.png	in the same terms.
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-00.png	This emphasis on the legality of the former
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-01.png	Government suggests that all is not well
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-02.png	with the political and military leadership
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-03.png	of the pro-communists. Most of the
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-04.png	province of Xieng Khouang and the
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-05.png	tactically useful Plain of Jars, however,
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-06.png	appear still to be firmly in their hands.
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-07.png	The Government has claimed the
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-08.png	recapture of Vang Vieng, the pro-
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-09.png	communists' former base 60 miles
data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-10.png	north of Vientiane, but this claim
data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-00.png	A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-01.png	a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that
data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-02.png	this village was still held by the pro-communists.

data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-06.png	Party are holding a national conference here with
data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-07.png	some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since 1958
data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-08.png	when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-09.png	leader.
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-00.png	Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-01.png	a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-02.png	which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-03.png	of the party since it came to office three and
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-04.png	a half years ago. Nevertheless there is little
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-05.png	illusion in the Conservative Party that their
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-06.png	stock at home has fallen in the face of
data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-07.png	heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy.
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-00.png	Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-01.png	provincial governments, Quebec and New Brunswick, and
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-02.png	in the four federal by-elections last October the party
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-03.png	fared badly. They are now faced with four other by-
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-04.png	elections, one at Esquimalt Saanich, British Columbia,
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-05.png	one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-06.png	Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska, New Brunswick,
data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-07.png	and Kings, Prince Edward Island.
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-00.png	However, a separate poll revealed that Mr.
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-01.png	Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-02.png	popularity as an individual leader (for
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-03.png	Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent, for Mr.
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-04.png	Pearson 34 per cent). How far is Mr.
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-05.png	Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-06.png	of Canada as a Prime Minister? Many
data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-07.png	observers at the national rally will be

data/a03/a03-059/a03-059-05.png	unemployment, but there will be 21

data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-03.png	European space satellite project, will find the Germans
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-04.png	interested in the principle of space research, but rather
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-05.png	sceptical about British plans for organizing it.
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-06.png	Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-07.png	this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-08.png	salve Blue Streak, which was abandoned last summer
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-09.png	as a military project; or that the European space satellite
data/a03/a03-063/a03-063-10.png	is indeed to be purely scientific in character.
data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-00.png	Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-01.png	remove these doubts, and to persuade the

data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-03.png	involved is really worth while, at a time when
data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-04.png	any increase in budgetary commitments
data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-05.png	would almost certainly involve a corresponding

data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-03.png	House, Whitehall, yesterday. Much of their
data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-04.png	three hours, 20 minutes of discussion is believed
data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-05.png	to have been devoted to this main point
data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-06.png	of American policy.
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-00.png	It arose during talks following
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-01.png	President Kennedy's report to the British
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-02.png	Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-03.png	visit to Paris. There General de Gaulle had made
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-04.png	clear that he would accept Britain into the
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-05.png	Common Market only if there were no conditions
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-06.png	laid down to meet the Commonwealth
data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-07.png	and other reservations.
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-00.png	Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-01.png	wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-02.png	Market, even if it meant an unconditional surrender.
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-03.png	There were also brief discussions on Laos, Berlin
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-04.png	and other foreign questions, after Mr. Kennedy had
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-05.png	informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-06.png	Krushchov. With the exception of 40 minutes when
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-07.png	Lord Home, Foreign Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge
data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-08.png	Bundy, the President's special assistant for

data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-04.png	for a statement. President Kennedy flew from London

data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-06.png	morning. He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide

data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-02.png	Washington - said: &quot;Their discussions covered the major problems,
data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-03.png	both economic and political, and revealed once again the
data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-04.png	close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-05.png	common purposes. &quot;Occasion was given to review the need for
data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-06.png	economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests
data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-07.png	of developed and underdeveloped countries alike.&quot;
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-00.png	It said that the President and Premier noted &quot;with satisfaction&quot; the
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-01.png	agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire,
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-02.png	which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-03.png	Geneva conference. &quot;Particular attention was also given to the
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-04.png	nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament. &quot;The
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-05.png	situation in regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was full
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-06.png	agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-07.png	obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin.&quot;
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-00.png	Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-01.png	given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-02.png	guests present, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-03.png	times yesterday. In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-04.png	State, gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-05.png	15-nation Nato council. Some of his listeners said he was
data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-06.png	&quot;rather pessimistic&quot; and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.
data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-00.png	From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-01.png	and informed him of the Vienna outcome. Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-02.png	in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-03.png	fly home with the President. In DUESSELDORF, Chancellor Adenauer
data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-04.png	said the Vienna talks &quot;might be the beginning of a slight improvement,&quot;
data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-05.png	but no big changes should be expected in the political situation.
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-00.png	RELAXED, smiling and clearly in the best of
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-01.png	spirits, Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-02.png	Moscow after his two days of talks with President
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-03.png	Kennedy, writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow. The
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-04.png	good beginning made at Vienna must be
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-05.png	followed up by new efforts for peace, the
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-06.png	Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-07.png	declared yesterday. Events in Vienna &quot;gave hope
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-08.png	to people of goodwill who hate the cold war,
data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-09.png	and to all who are striving for a stable peace,&quot;
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-00.png	&quot;Thinking over the results of the Vienna
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-01.png	meeting, peace-loving people will say 'a
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-02.png	good beginning.'&quot; Mr. Krushchov remained at the
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-03.png	airport to join President Brezhnev in welcoming
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-04.png	Dr. Sukarno, President and Prime Minister of
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-05.png	Indonesia, who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-06.png	state visit 40 minutes after Mr. Khrushchov had
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-07.png	arrived from Vienna. A cheering, delighted crowd
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-08.png	of Indonesian students broke through crash barriers
data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-09.png	to surround their President on the tarmac for
data/a04/a04-039/a04-039-00.png	In VIENNA, before flying off to Moscow,
data/a04/a04-039/a04-039-01.png	Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend
data/a04/a04-039/a04-039-02.png	talks with President Kennedy would # help &quot;to
data/a04/a04-039/a04-039-03.png	establish an enduring peace between nations.&quot;
data/a04/a04-039/a04-039-04.png	Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President

data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-00.png	MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-01.png	defence of the Polaris missile base. And by
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-02.png	implication he supported the establishment of
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-03.png	sites in Britain for the training of German
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-04.png	troops. His main theme was that nuclear
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-05.png	weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-06.png	Britain must depend on Nato and &quot;the West&quot;
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-07.png	must have nuclear weapons so long as the
data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-08.png	Soviet Union has them.
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-00.png	The General Council of the Trades Union
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-01.png	Congress should therefore consider the
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-02.png	matter. Consideration should also be given
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-03.png	to the regrouping of unions and the
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-04.png	modification of their structures to
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-05.png	meet the growing concentration of
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-06.png	capital. Mr. Cooper argued that a
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-07.png	common industrial contribution was
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-08.png	urgent - particularly in unions serving
data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-09.png	workers in the same industry - along

data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-03.png	argued that the position needed examination.

data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-05.png	Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-06.png	the views of a wide section of the
data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-07.png	British people about Polaris submarine
data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-08.png	bases in this country. An open letter
data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-09.png	written by Earl Russell hoping that the
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-00.png	Earl Russell, President of the Committee
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-01.png	of 100, told Kennedy that he should
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-02.png	take notice of &quot;that very large and
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-03.png	growing section which is opposed to
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-04.png	the establishment of a Polaris base,
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-05.png	whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-06.png	British territory.&quot; He pointed out that
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-07.png	already there have been protests but
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-08.png	that &quot;very much larger protests are to
data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-09.png	be expected and are being planned.&quot;
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-00.png	Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-01.png	offer the Government an easy passage for such
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-02.png	legislation. &quot;Why don't you make proposals to legislate
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-03.png	in the autumn?&quot; Mr. Wilson asked. &quot;We wouldn't call
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-04.png	it an Autumn Budget. You can call it a Taxation
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-05.png	Management Bill, if you like.&quot; While Mr. Wilson
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-06.png	was speaking, the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd
data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-07.png	had a whispered conversation.
data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-00.png	He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-01.png	ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said: &quot;Our rules
data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-02.png	say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-03.png	for three years. &quot;I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire,
data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-04.png	so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-05.png	I should commit hara-kiri.
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-00.png	The other TUC demands: Five leading
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-01.png	Communists must not hold office for five
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-02.png	years; Sub-committees set up to strip
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-03.png	secretary John Byrne of his powers must
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-04.png	disband in ten days. These the ETU
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-05.png	executive rejected as &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot;
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-06.png	and &quot;unwarranted&quot; interference.&quot; But it
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-07.png	agreed to postpone operation of the sub-
data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-08.png	committees.
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-00.png	&quot;The whole naval might of the Soviet
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-01.png	Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-02.png	and proud sight,&quot; said Moscow radio's
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-03.png	commentator. The parade was reviewed by
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-04.png	Marshal Andrei Grechko, commanding the
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-05.png	forces of the Warsaw Pact countries -

data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-09.png	MACMILLAN'S announcement in the
data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-10.png	Commons of his momentous
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-00.png	Mr. Anthony Fell (Yarmouth) called the decision &quot;shocking&quot;
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-01.png	and added: &quot;It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-02.png	Minister has done for many, many generations.&quot; He
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-03.png	concluded: &quot;The best service the Prime Minister can do
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-04.png	would be to resign.&quot; The outburst shocked MPs of
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-05.png	all parties. Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-06.png	to stop.
data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-00.png	This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more. &quot;I cannot be told
data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-01.png	to sit down by the Prime Minister.&quot; Protests had been expected
data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-02.png	from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented. He
data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-03.png	accused the Prime Minister of &quot;political double talk.&quot; &quot;It had
data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-04.png	the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-05.png	Minister is a national disaster,&quot; he said.
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-00.png	Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had, if
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-01.png	anything, rallied support to the Prime Minister.
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-02.png	This apparently, was Mr. Macmillan's assessment.
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-03.png	He confined his reply to the observation
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-04.png	that Mr. Fell had probably &quot;maximised his
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-05.png	support.&quot; There were no other attacks
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-06.png	of such ferocity. But there was ample
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-07.png	evidence of Conservative and Labour
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-08.png	opposition, which will be aired in the
data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-09.png	debate tomorrow and on Thursday.
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-00.png	As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement, the
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-01.png	House was crowded. He said: &quot;No # British
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-02.png	Government could join the European Economic
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-03.png	Community without prior negotiation with a view
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-04.png	to meeting the needs of the Commonwealth countries,
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-05.png	of our European Free Trade Association partners
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-06.png	and of British agriculture.&quot; Near the end of a
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-07.png	long statement, Mr. Macmillan stated the
data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-08.png	Government's intention:
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-00.png	&quot;After long and earnest consideration, Her
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-01.png	Majesty's Government have come to the
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-02.png	conclusion that it would be right for
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-03.png	Britain to make a formal application..
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-04.png	for negotiations with a view to joining
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-05.png	the Community.&quot; At this point, Mr. Paul
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-06.png	Williams (Cons., Sunderland) called out
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-07.png	&quot;Shame.&quot; Mr. Williams is a close
data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-08.png	associate of Mr. Fell.
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-00.png	He claimed that, unless we were in the
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-01.png	Common Market, we should not be able to
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-02.png	play any part in # determining its future.
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-03.png	&quot;We can lead better from within,&quot; he said.
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-04.png	Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-05.png	raised by Tory critics. Mr. Anthony Fell,
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-06.png	who created a scene on this point on
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-07.png	Monday, took up a position almost hidden
data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-08.png	behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair.
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-00.png	Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-01.png	to the Commonwealth through the
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-02.png	strength we would gain in the Common
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-03.png	Market than by isolation. He paid
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-04.png	tribute to the development of the
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-05.png	Common Market. &quot;The Community
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-06.png	(Common Market) has imparted an
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-07.png	impetus and an economic growth
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-08.png	to The Six. Above all, it is an idea
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-09.png	which has gripped men's minds,&quot;
data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-10.png	he said.
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-00.png	Referring to previous negotiations, Mr. Macmillan looked towards
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-01.png	Mr. Reginald Maudling. &quot;These were negotiations in which the
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-02.png	President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part,&quot; the
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-03.png	Premier said. He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-04.png	swamped by cheap labour. Our industry, he said, would
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-05.png	probably gain. &quot;Many people feel we have had, perhaps, too
data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-06.png	much shelter,&quot; he went on.
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-00.png	She was tempted to laugh, but it was as though that barb still stuck
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-01.png	in her quivering flesh. &quot;You've an answer - of sorts - for everything,&quot; she
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-02.png	said shortly. &quot;Personally I've no more to say, so I suggest we get
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-03.png	along.&quot; To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-04.png	where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-05.png	leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and
data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-06.png	incredibly ancient car, surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives.
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-00.png	Conservatives protested when
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-01.png	Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-02.png	told this "by some # people
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-03.png	of considerable authority," he
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-04.png	retorted. "I agree with the Prime
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-05.png	Minister that I do not think
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-06.png	we are necessarily bound for
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-07.png	federalism in Europe," he went
data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-08.png	on.
data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-00.png	If we joined the Common Market, our
data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-01.png	food subsidies would probably be
data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-02.png	replaced by a system of tariffs &quot;That
data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-03.png	will mean a rise in the cost of living.&quot;

data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-07.png	On the eve of August Bank Holiday

data/a06/a06-152/a06-152-00.png	Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-
data/a06/a06-152/a06-152-01.png	determination is the intention to impose

data/a06/a06-152/a06-152-06.png	speech scared 1,157 East Germans to

data/b01/b01-000/b01-000-01.png	in revulsion against the South African

data/b01/b01-000/b01-000-03.png	for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
data/b01/b01-000/b01-000-04.png	Conference in London. Will it end with
data/b01/b01-000/b01-000-05.png	South Africa's exclusion from the
data/b01/b01-000/b01-000-06.png	Commonwealth? The issue is touch and go.
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-00.png	There is a possibility that it will not be
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-01.png	settled at this conference. It may be agreed to
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-02.png	wait until South Africa actually becomes a
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-03.png	Republic later in the year. But if a final
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-04.png	decision is to be faced now, on which side
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-05.png	do the strongest arguments lie? THE Archbishop
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-06.png	of Capetown has shown that the matter is
data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-07.png	not clear-cut.
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-00.png	The Archbishop has long been a courageous
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-01.png	fighter against apartheid. He must be heard
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-02.png	with attention. On purely practical grounds he
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-03.png	holds that it would be a mistake to expel
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-04.png	South Africa, weakening the whites who are
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-05.png	working for a change of policy. In his view
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-06.png	it would also be against the interests of the
data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-07.png	Africans.
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-00.png	He holds that more pressure can be put on South

data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-02.png	than could be exercised were she cut off from it.
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-03.png	On the other hand, those who favour expulsion, inclu-
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-04.png	ding African leaders, feel that nothing less than the
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-05.png	shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-06.png	Verwoerd and the Nationalists. They point out
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-07.png	that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-08.png	the apartheid policy.
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-00.png	THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society. A
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-01.png	policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-02.png	is surely the one thing that it could not survive.
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-03.png	Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-04.png	London, millions at home would regard as fraudulent
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-05.png	a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-06.png	South Africa. And this is a Commonwealth in
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-07.png	which five citizens are coloured for every one
data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-08.png	who is white.
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-00.png	Seen in this wider picture, a South Africa that clings to
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-01.png	apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-02.png	liability to the whole Western world. A practical
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-03.png	solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-04.png	a set of principles excluding race discrimination.
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-05.png	And so leave South Africa to make the grade,
data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-06.png	or go out.
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-00.png	Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-01.png	as a means to curb rising prices at home. She is
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-02.png	also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-03.png	by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-04.png	should. Germany exports much more than she imports.
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-05.png	For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-06.png	dollars have been drained into Germany.
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-00.png	There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-01.png	Germany has no tradition of trading abroad. In addition
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-02.png	the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-03.png	speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars,
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-04.png	hoping for the mark to rise, as has now happened.
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-05.png	WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-06.png	Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-07.png	off speculation against dollar and pound?
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-00.png	That is doubtful. If however, in addition to her new
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-01.png	good-neighbour gesture, Germany takes a really big
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-02.png	share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations, the
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-03.png	world outlook will be brighter. What gives rise
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-04.png	to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-05.png	other leading Western nations are at long last
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-06.png	moving towards a solution of currency problems
data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-07.png	by co-operation.
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-00.png	The first reaction of the Sudanese
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-01.png	Government was to denounce the United
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-02.png	Nations for &quot;negligence and impotence,&quot; and
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-03.png	to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-04.png	would be taken home. The reaction can be
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-05.png	understood. The Sudan's concern for its
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-06.png	men is natural. But this could hardly be
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-07.png	a # dignified exit. IF the UN is
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-08.png	blamed for being weak, it would be
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-09.png	more logical to send in more men,
data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-10.png	not weaken it further by desertion.
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-00.png	It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-01.png	Hammarskjold and the UN's servants. The
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-02.png	responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-03.png	which have undertaken the task of pre-
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-04.png	serving peace in the Congo. That is not a
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-05.png	ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-06.png	right to blame the politicians unless they see
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-07.png	it through. When the United Nations instructed
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-08.png	Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-09.png	prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers
data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-10.png	would arise unless it gave him the political ...
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-00.png	That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-01.png	made. India has responded handsomely by providing
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-02.png	3,000 men, who must take about a fortnight to arrive.
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-03.png	If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground,
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-04.png	such incidents as that at Matadi would not
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-05.png	happen. THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-06.png	simply on adequate support by the nations
data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-07.png	which have set their hands to this plough.
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-00.png	The big Powers involved in the Cold War
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-01.png	must of course keep out. The Americans were
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-02.png	justified in diverting naval ships in case
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-03.png	non-combatant help was wanted; but they
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-04.png	stressed that there was no intention to intervene
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-05.png	in fighting. Yesterday the ships turned away
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-06.png	again, satisfied that they were not required.
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-07.png	It is to be hoped that the UN will be
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-08.png	re-established in their port by negotiation
data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-09.png	and that there will be no more outrages.
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-00.png	But back, Mr. Hammarskjold is determined,
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-01.png	they must go. The best news for the Congo
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-02.png	would be agreement between its rival
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-03.png	political leaders. Through the patient efforts
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-04.png	of UN conciliators they are meeting for
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-05.png	the first time, in Malagasy (formerly
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-06.png	Madagascar). THE world will sigh with
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-07.png	relief when this strife-torn land gets
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-08.png	itself a government which all outsiders
data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-09.png	can recognise.
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-00.png	ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-01.png	as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as &quot;a
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-02.png	policy of good neighbourliness.&quot; We may be sure that
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-03.png	he is not being hypocritical. That is what he
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-04.png	really believes. A good neighbour to those Africans
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-05.png	who, under apartheid, will be forced back to
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-06.png	their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-07.png	cramped and primitive existence.
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-00.png	A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-01.png	tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-02.png	water in the white areas of South Africa, without rights
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-03.png	and without hope. THE same sort of good neighbour
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-04.png	that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-05.png	Hitler in the thirties. It was Dr. Verwoerd who
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-06.png	led a protest against admitting any of them
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-07.png	because they would &quot;defile&quot; the national
data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-08.png	white stock.
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-00.png	It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-01.png	woerd in his nightmare world. It is this that
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-02.png	makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-03.png	fluenced to change course. The Archbishop of
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-04.png	Capetown, Dr. Joost de Blank, has pleaded that
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-05.png	South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-06.png	Commonwealth. Otherwise, he says, those inside the
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-07.png	country who still oppose apartheid will be
data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-08.png	left even more isolated and alone.
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-00.png	What seems certain is that those who
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-01.png	advocate putting off any approach until
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-02.png	Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-03.png	of heart (whatever that may mean) would
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-04.png	have us run risks greater than the West
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-05.png	ought to run - and greater than President
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-06.png	Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-07.png	disposed to face. The real question is
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-08.png	what we should put to the Soviet
data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-09.png	Government as a basis for talks: and
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-00.png	On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-01.png	manoeuvring, and what we should call
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-02.png	cool-headed and inventive negotiation, is
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-03.png	a means not to destruction but to safety.
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-04.png	The Government's pompous little statement
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-05.png	on Northern Rhodesia does not say much,
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-06.png	but it says what is necessary - that
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-07.png	the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-08.png	open to revision. This is news, however
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-09.png	much the Government tries to disguise
data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-10.png	it by saying that the revision would be
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-00.png	Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-01.png	this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June, made it
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-02.png	very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-03.png	principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-04.png	that the Government should ever have been led away
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-05.png	from this principle. It is a great pity that the
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-06.png	Government should give the appearance of responding, not
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-07.png	to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations, but to
data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-08.png	the violence which he tried to prevent.
data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-00.png	But they were so convinced and they
data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-01.png	have had to take the consequences. Mean-
data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-02.png	while in Germany itself the course of
data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-03.png	the campaign has dismayed a good
data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-04.png	many people: they too will be glad
data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-05.png	when the polling stations close.
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-00.png	But discussion on current points of east-west con-
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-01.png	flict could not go much farther than, for example, the
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-02.png	truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-03.png	cannot be followed together. What the council has done -
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-04.png	and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-05.png	tact across the greatest political barrier in what
data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-06.png	is not yet a unitary world.
data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-00.png	The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-01.png	agreement is signed. To this there will be some opposition. The Bill is
data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-02.png	short and modest in scope, and it is doubtful whether the other Private
data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-03.png	Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps. This fact may give
data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-04.png	the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-05.png	next report from the Molony committee.
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-00.png	Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable. They should not,
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-01.png	however, disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-02.png	parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run.
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-03.png	Centigrade v. Fahrenheit. The fight is on. The challenger has behind
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-04.png	it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-05.png	but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-06.png	logical Office.
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-00.png	The press and the broadcasting authorities are
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-01.png	asked to help. To begin with, both tempe-
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-02.png	ratures will be put in the ring together.
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-03.png	SIR GRAHAM SUTTON, however, made no bones
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-04.png	about it yesterday. The purpose is to give
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-05.png	fahrenheit the knock out. The backers of
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-06.png	centigrade would have got off to a better
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-07.png	start if they had taken more pains to
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-08.png	explain the advantages to the general
data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-09.png	public of the change.
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-00.png	In any case, fahrenheit need not lose heart.
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-01.png	Once before, and that not so long ago, the
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-02.png	authorities ganged up to alter the habits
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-03.png	of the people. That effort was to enforce
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-04.png	the adoption of the twenty-four hour
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-05.png	clock. Then, also, the B.B.C. were
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-06.png	roped in. The only result was
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-07.png	that the well-meaning corporation
data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-08.png	became very unpopular.

data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-04.png	the murder of Patrice Lumumba. Her

data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-05.png	pastime. Why? Because those who
data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-06.png	said the Congolese could govern themselves
data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-07.png	will not admit they were wrong. So
data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-08.png	Belgium, bowed down by internal
data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-09.png	troubles, mourning a terrible air crash,
data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-10.png	is made their scapegoat.
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-00.png	Who will speak for Belgium? Who else but
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-01.png	Britain. We have fought beside Belgium
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-02.png	in two world wars. We are allies still.
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-03.png	Britain should champion Belgium. Not
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-04.png	with the careful, hooded language of diplomacy,
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-05.png	but boldly and fearlessly. It is time to
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-06.png	show the world that this country does not
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-07.png	desert her friends. HAPPY, happy
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-08.png	families! Never before have Britain's
data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-09.png	larders been so well stocked.
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-00.png	Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-01.png	substantially higher last year than in 1959.
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-02.png	Lucky, lucky housewives! To have such a
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-03.png	splendid variety of goods to choose from.
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-04.png	Not so long ago older folk were reminding
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-05.png	young wives, # harassed by
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-06.png	shortages, of the good old days of
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-07.png	abundance. Now it is mother who
data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-08.png	picks up recipes from # her daughter.
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-00.png	Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today?
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-01.png	Head for the parks to enjoy the sun. Not in
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-02.png	a foolish cause, but in a glorious one. Good health!
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-03.png	THIS group of men, says a report, work on average
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-04.png	between 55 and 60 hours a week. They also put
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-05.png	in an extra two or three evenings. And they never
data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-06.png	go on strike.
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-00.png	Who are they? The trade union officials of Britain.
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-01.png	Men who earn only a fraction of what their
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-02.png	talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-03.png	labour market. The unions are fortunate indeed to
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-04.png	find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices. But it is
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-05.png	time the members decided to pay up and be good
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-06.png	employers. THE Labour Party says that the Tory
data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-07.png	Government is destroying the social services.
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-00.png	Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-01.png	national income was spent on social services. The
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-02.png	present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-03.png	worthwhile targets for the Opposition. What a pity
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-04.png	to aim at the wrong one! MRS. MARCIA POWER,
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-05.png	whose husband made her clean his uniform, wins
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-06.png	a divorce. The judge says she had to act almost
data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-07.png	as a serf.
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-00.png	Up and down the country husbands will be saying
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-01.png	they would never behave like that. But do they ever
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-02.png	ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-03.png	returned to the shed; their books tidied; and often,
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-04.png	even their shoes cleaned? How wonderful if they
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-05.png	showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-06.png	box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers!
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-00.png	For expansion today means still greater
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-01.png	prosperity tomorrow. BERTRAND RUSSELL,
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-02.png	the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-03.png	the-Bomb crusade, has devoted following.
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-04.png	Thousands march with him - and sit with him
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-05.png	too. It is said by some that he is a saint; by
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-06.png	others that he is a prophet. He is, in fact, a
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-07.png	philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-08.png	who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-09.png	issues of our time.
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-00.png	BEFORE the war he urged the British people
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-01.png	to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists.
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-02.png	After the war he favoured a preventive war against
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-03.png	Russia. Now he wants Britain to demolish her
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-04.png	defences. Throughout the years Lord Russell
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-05.png	and his supporters have been able to pursue their
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-06.png	eccentric campaigns in freedom. They should
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-07.png	ask themselves this question: How long would
data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-08.png	that freedom last if their policies were adopted?
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-00.png	AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-01.png	Board. The board is laying a cable along a seven-
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-02.png	mile route in Surrey. A warden, Mr. Jack Finlay,
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-03.png	has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-04.png	householders when trenches are dug outside their
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-05.png	front gates. Splendid. By showing concern
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-06.png	for the people the board will earn their good will.
data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-07.png	Happy patrolling, Mr. Finlay!
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-00.png	GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky! The tough,
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-01.png	resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-02.png	shakes the life out of his critics. He calls them
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-03.png	&quot;jelly-boned.&quot; He promises to preserve federation
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-04.png	against African fanatics and woolly minded
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-05.png	individuals in the West. Some may ask: Is
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-06.png	Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-07.png	disagree with him? The facts answer that.
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-00.png	CONTRAST his firm, successful rule in Rhodesia
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-01.png	with what has happened in the Congo. There
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-02.png	Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-03.png	into practice. There a UNO army of Africans,
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-04.png	bossed by an Indian, has been in charge for
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-05.png	months. And what has it made of the Congo?
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-06.png	A bloodstained shambles. No wonder
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-07.png	Welensky has lost all patience with his
data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-08.png	misguided tormentors.
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-00.png	They have earned his strictures. And his
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-01.png	contempt. SOME people are for ever complaining
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-02.png	that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-03.png	when they get it. Now a survey of the Post
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-04.png	Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-05.png	idea is. The biggest group of depositors in
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-06.png	the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-07.png	to 19.
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-00.png	Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before.
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-01.png	Certainly they spend more. But how splendid
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-02.png	that in the most prosperous days in this
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-03.png	country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-04.png	should still have a powerful appeal for young
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-05.png	people. THE Danes are annoyed with British
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-06.png	farmers for fighting against Danish competition.
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-07.png	They say that our farmers do not seem to
data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-08.png	understand the meaning of free trade.
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-00.png	There is no doubt what the Danes understand
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-01.png	by free trade. It is that they should be free
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-02.png	to sell as much as they like, while buying
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-03.png	more and more from our rivals. Germany has
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-04.png	now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-05.png	principal supplier. The farmers of Britain
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-06.png	understand free trade. That is why they fight
data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-07.png	it.
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-00.png	THE Palace cinema at Buckley, near Chester, will be
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-01.png	reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-02.png	Platt, both aged 19. Eric says: &quot;We believe in the
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-03.png	cinema. And we know what people want.&quot; The
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-04.png	combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-05.png	of public taste has launched many great
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-06.png	enterprises. Barry and Eric have enthusiasm. They
data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-07.png	are backed by a resurgent film industry.
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-00.png	It could be curtain up on two success stories. Of
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-01.png	the old Palace. And Barry and Eric. DONS at
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-02.png	Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-03.png	an honours degree course. Farming is Britain's
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-04.png	most vital industry. It is increasingly dependent
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-05.png	on new techniques - and on the universities to
data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-06.png	provide men of knowledge and skill.
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-00.png	The older universities are often accused of being
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-01.png	interested only in dead subjects. Now Cambridge has
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-02.png	the opportunity to show is just as interested in the
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-03.png	living. Particularly as its rival, Oxford, has had a
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-04.png	similar course in farming for 15 years!
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-05.png	JOHN GLENN, Virgil Grissom, Alan Shepard. One of
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-06.png	these three men has a date with destiny - the
data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-07.png	first journey into Space.
data/b04/b04-208/b04-208-00.png	At the beginning of this wonderful century many
data/b04/b04-208/b04-208-01.png	people believed that there were no more worlds to
data/b04/b04-208/b04-208-02.png	conquer.
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-00.png	The travellers from the New World who had
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-01.png	been in Britain many times before, were
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-02.png	slightly stunned. Afterwards they said: &quot;We thought
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-03.png	we knew it all, but you Britishers never run
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-04.png	out of unturned stones.&quot;
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-05.png	To the British Travel Association, doing their excellent
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-06.png	darndest, I offer these sad complexities. IN the 1830's
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-07.png	the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-08.png	many a good trade unionist since then has, in the
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-09.png	hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers, taken
data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-10.png	the theoretical Luddite hammer again.
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-00.png	Hence the hostility to automation and
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-01.png	the stop-watch manufacturing methods that
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-02.png	have # led to restrictive practices. Now a new
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-03.png	threat to those who toil and spin has been
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-04.png	developed by a firm specialising in electronics
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-05.png	in Los Angeles. They have developed a new
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-06.png	system whereby completely untrained workers
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-07.png	can be taught their trade by means of tape
data/b05/b05-038/b05-038-08.png	recordings and television.
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-00.png	What happens is that the unskilled worker
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-01.png	is processed, by high-speed listening to recorded
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-02.png	instructions on how to do the job coupled with
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-03.png	explanatory TV pictures, into becoming a highly
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-04.png	skilled, obedient craftsman in no time at all.
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-05.png	Not only can the raw human mind be
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-06.png	technically equipped very quickly to do one
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-07.png	set of skilled manufacturing processes in one
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-08.png	trade but, by being given another of the new
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-09.png	audio-TV training techniques, he can be switched
data/b05/b05-042/b05-042-10.png	to a different industry if he just gives in and
data/b05/b05-045/b05-045-00.png	From being an assembler in an aircraft
data/b05/b05-045/b05-045-01.png	factory to becoming a paint sprayer in

data/b05/b05-045/b05-045-03.png	for a completely new job in less time
data/b05/b05-045/b05-045-04.png	than it takes to say &quot;Tolpuddle
data/b05/b05-045/b05-045-05.png	Martyrs!&quot; &quot;CRICKET,&quot; says the Oxford
data/b05/b05-045/b05-045-06.png	Dictionary, is &quot;an open air game played

data/b05/b05-050/b05-050-00.png	You are out of date. Cricket in 1961 is played

data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-03.png	efficient cog in the machine, he now claims that part of the
data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-04.png	endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-05.png	"decent, feasible and workable."
data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-00.png	He feels satisfaction &quot;from the fact that my personality had been
data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-01.png	tested and weighed and not found wanting.&quot; He feels like
data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-02.png	Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-03.png	saying: &quot;I am innocent of the blood of this just person.&quot;
data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-04.png	Like Dr. Globke, whom I interviewed the other day, Eichmann
data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-05.png	said:
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-00.png	"I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-01.png	could despite my low rank." Eichmann is on dangerous ground
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-02.png	when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-03.png	of the triangle that led to Hitler, Himmler, Hess and Goering
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-04.png	at the apex. In examination he betrayed an expert and
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-05.png	intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-06.png	led to the top.
data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-00.png	He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-01.png	meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man
data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-02.png	who used the system - and used it with power and authority.
data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-03.png	The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-04.png	selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-05.png	red with blood.
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-00.png	So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-01.png	&quot;Werewolves&quot; that we had contemplated the necessity of very
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-02.png	special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen. Particular
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-03.png	hatred, we felt, was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-04.png	those who had, over the years, spread such ghastly havoc, destruction
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-05.png	and death over Germany, causing such wholesale slaughter among
data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-06.png	men, women and children, old and young alike.
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-00.png	5. Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-01.png	are highway payments, clearance payments (for clearing remains of
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-02.png	structures from &quot;total loss&quot; sites) and church payments. Although
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-03.png	differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-04.png	works payments, the sums paid under these heads have the
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-05.png	common feature that they are all payments in respect of works
data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-06.png	which have been carried out.
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-00.png	They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-01.png	was an iniquitous injustice. When they burst into
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-02.png	Czechoslovakia, Poland, Holland, Belgium and France
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-03.png	they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-04.png	them that they were being &quot;encircled.&quot; They really
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-05.png	believed in the moral superiority of &quot;The New
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-06.png	Order&quot; which Himmler on October 4, 1943, expressed
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-07.png	thus: &quot;Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-08.png	to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-09.png	need them as slaves to # our Kultur; otherwise
data/b05/b05-074/b05-074-10.png	it is of no interest to me.
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-00.png	The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-01.png	more than a fantasy. Thanks to the good
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-02.png	sense of the front line soldiers, the
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-03.png	meeting of East and West was marked by
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-04.png	the use of no weapon more lethal than
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-05.png	vodka. And the effect on the German people
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-06.png	of the first ten years of the promised
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-07.png	thousand of Nazi rule, so far from creating
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-08.png	a spirit of warlike frenzy, had produced
data/g05/g05-094/g05-094-09.png	universally a dull bewildered apathy.
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-00.png	This concept of slavery included Britain.
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-01.png	General Brauchitsch signed a directive
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-02.png	ordering that after the successful
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-03.png	invasion of our islands all the &quot;able-bodied
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-04.png	male population between the ages of
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-05.png	seventeen and forty-five will, unless the
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-06.png	local situation calls for an exceptional
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-07.png	ruling, be interned and dispatched to the
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-08.png	Continent.&quot; The Baltic States were
data/b05/b05-079/b05-079-09.png	to have been our destination.
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-00.png	In no other conquered country, not even
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-01.png	Poland, had the Germans begun with such a
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-02.png	drastic step. There is no doubt that the compatriots
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-03.png	of Eichmann would have been as good as their
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-04.png	evil word. THE Inland Revenue people have a
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-05.png	thankless task. But they do not make
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-06.png	themselves less disliked by their attitude
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-07.png	to their customers - who incidentally
data/b05/b05-083/b05-083-08.png	pay their salaries.
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-00.png	It was called &quot;Abou Ben Adhem and the
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-01.png	Angel.&quot; I don't know why I was so
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-02.png	impressed with this poem but, on re-
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-03.png	flection, it might be that I took a
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-04.png	guilty interest in the devilment busi-
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-05.png	ness. I may well have felt that I was
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-06.png	hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-07.png	upbringing and a possible reprieve might
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-08.png	come through the sugary sentiments
data/b05/b05-098/b05-098-09.png	of &quot;Abou Ben Adhem.&quot;
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-00.png	Their demands are invariably couched in
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-01.png	hectoring, out-of-date language, but in spite of all
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-02.png	their bluster, they let many a big fish through the
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-03.png	net while they are bullying the minnows. I have just
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-04.png	heard a good example of their officious efficiency.
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-05.png	A young chap I know got his first job last week. He
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-06.png	is paid monthly in arrears and will not get
data/b05/b05-088/b05-088-07.png	a bean for the next twenty-one days.
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-00.png	SOME 17 years ago, in the early summer of 1934,
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-01.png	the German ambassador in London was dictating
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-02.png	a secret report to his chief von Papen, in Berlin.
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-03.png	&quot;Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-04.png	of German rearmament, in opposition, to France.&quot;
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-05.png	Later that year he warned that Britain knew
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-06.png	Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-07.png	building bombers, and added:
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-00.png	Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-01.png	Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-02.png	up. These &quot;fighters&quot; are in fact fighter bombers
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-03.png	which could launch an atomic attack on
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-04.png	Eastern Europe. By 1963 the Germans plan to have
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-05.png	nine missile battalions, with 288 missiles and
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-06.png	36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador
data/b06/b06-023/b06-023-07.png	(range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-00.png	This week of window dressing will not prevent
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-01.png	most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-02.png	in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-03.png	jobs. It needs more than 10,000 church parades
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-04.png	and open days at techs, more than descents into
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-05.png	Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-06.png	Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
data/b06/b06-097/b06-097-07.png	catch up with the space age.
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-00.png	Among other incidents he was banned from New
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-01.png	York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a &quot;disorderly
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-02.png	person.&quot; He was in a fight after telling a
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-03.png	Canadian, during a chat about space-flight:
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-04.png	&quot;Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit, Israel
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-05.png	will put a matzo ball into orbit, and Lichtenstein
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-06.png	will put a postage stamp into orbit before you
data/c06/c06-039/c06-039-07.png	Canadians put up a mouse.&quot;
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-00.png	So all ends as you know it will, with the
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-01.png	middle-aged romancers respectably wed and
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-02.png	Master Darin going steady with the delectable
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-03.png	Sandra Dee (to whom, I believe, he is married
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-04.png	in real life). Miss Dee, incidentally, who keeps
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-05.png	turning up as the typical teenager in all the
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-06.png	&quot;good girl&quot; parts (Tuesday Weld gets the &quot;bad girl&quot;
data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-07.png	ones), is becoming quite an accomplished actress.
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-00.png	&quot;Without Britain's tolerance German rearma-
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-01.png	ment in the air would be jeopardised.&quot; When
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-02.png	Hoesch's reports, along with other nazi documents,
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-03.png	were captured and published after the war the
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-04.png	pattern of British Government connivance became
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-05.png	clear. At nazi Germany's request, Britain was
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-06.png	providing the cloak for Germany to build an
data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-07.png	air force bigger than that of France.
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-00.png	When Scarborough carried our point of view
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-01.png	we were naturally delighted, more so because
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-02.png	the alternatives had been put clearly to the
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-03.png	movement, which had then chosen a vigorous
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-04.png	anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-05.png	rearmament policy. Hopes rose as we saw a
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-06.png	perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-07.png	lines of difference with the Tories. Many members
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-08.png	understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-09.png	of the union would become easier in the context
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-00.png	At the same time that unity cannot be
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-01.png	established on a false basis, or by creating
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-02.png	further confusion within the movement. Unity
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-03.png	will never be established on the basis of leaders
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-04.png	being a law unto themselves and opposing
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-05.png	conference decisions when it suits their own
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-06.png	convenience. Unity can never be established by
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-07.png	any formula uniting those who oppose German
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-08.png	troops being trained on British soil and Polaris,
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-09.png	and those who are for this policy - which is the
data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-10.png	same as that of the Tory Government.
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-00.png	This sort of situation calls for some subtle,
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-01.png	slightly sardonic handling. It doesn't get it. But
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-02.png	The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-03.png	time. I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-04.png	Studies attached to some American universities
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-05.png	the subject Social Psychology used to be called
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-06.png	Home-making and is now known as Domestic
data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-07.png	Relations.
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-00.png	Yesterday West German Defence Minister,
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-01.png	Herr Strauss, started talks with the British
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-02.png	Defence Minister, Mr. Watkinson. Their talks
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-03.png	are another stage in the cloak operation,
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-04.png	1961 variety, by which the West German
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-05.png	militarists are advancing their rearmament.
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-06.png	Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-07.png	that his policy was to make his country
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-08.png	the &quot;strongest militarily in Europe and the
data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-09.png	United States' principal Nato ally.&quot;
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-00.png	They obstructed every effort to fight for the
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-01.png	Scarborough decisions, while # scratching
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-02.png	around frantically to overturn them next
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-03.png	time. Confusion of the original issue
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-04.png	by misrepresentation of the decisions,
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-05.png	the introduction of a pseudo third way
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-06.png	and the call for party unity - in effect,
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-07.png	a demand that the movement unite
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-08.png	with the Gaitskellites on their policy
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-09.png	and no other seems to have done the
data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-10.png	trick of moving a number of unions
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-00.png	This should strengthen the campaign to
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-01.png	end the manufacture and use of
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-02.png	nuclear weapons in Britain. Britain then
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-03.png	could play a leading and independent
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-04.png	role for an international agreement to ban
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-05.png	all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-06.png	destruction, and lay the basis for real
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-07.png	peace and progress. WHEN all the
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-08.png	ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-09.png	Week subsides it is doubtful whether more

data/c06/c06-005/c06-005-04.png	hard-core Friends of Brendan. They listen
data/c06/c06-005/c06-005-05.png	with many an obliging guffaw to the
data/c06/c06-005/c06-005-06.png	brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal
data/c06/c06-005/c06-005-07.png	roller-coaster, with occasional stops for an old
data/c06/c06-005/c06-005-08.png	I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker.
data/c06/c06-020/c06-020-00.png	That's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls-
data/c06/c06-020/c06-020-01.png	Royce a type of transport. She's the

data/c06/c06-020/c06-020-03.png	a journalist, I write to entertain rather
data/c06/c06-020/c06-020-04.png	than educate. And I don't write at all
data/c06/c06-020/c06-020-05.png	unless I'm exceedingly 2skint. &quot;But I'll
data/c06/c06-020/c06-020-06.png	say this. I'd like to live in America

data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-00.png	His job is to build up the military apparatus which
data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-01.png	will back West Germany's economic domination of Western
data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-02.png	Europe through the Common Market. He continued this week
data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-03.png	the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a
data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-04.png	Nato council meeting last year over the question: do we
data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-05.png	fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war?
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-00.png	Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-01.png	and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-02.png	control. Nato, far from being a means of controlling
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-03.png	the German militarists, is, in fact, the cover for
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-04.png	building up their power. What must Britain do? Today,
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-05.png	again, she has a key role. Let her tell men like Strauss
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-06.png	that he shall have no bases or &quot;facilities,&quot; no help in
data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-07.png	his quest for atomic arms.
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-00.png	But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-01.png	prefer unskilled jobs. Countless numbers who want training
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-02.png	are denied it. One area electricity board in 1958
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-03.png	offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-04.png	applications, of whom 100 were considered suitable by
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-05.png	the board. There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-06.png	boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth

data/b06/b06-015/b06-015-03.png	of course) and for those to have

data/b06/b06-015/b06-015-05.png	In the past year West Germany
data/b06/b06-015/b06-015-06.png	has secured agreements for

data/b06/b06-015/b06-015-09.png	the British Government has
data/b06/b06-015/b06-015-10.png	agreed to give similar &quot;facilities&quot;

data/b06/b06-053/b06-053-02.png	ignored it, the inconsistency
data/b06/b06-053/b06-053-03.png	between support for the war

data/b06/b06-071/b06-071-04.png	Gaitskell's stupid hope. The tragedy is
data/b06/b06-071/b06-071-05.png	that enormous inroads could already

data/c06/c06-076/c06-076-04.png	perfect timing and technique. It gives one loud,
data/c06/c06-076/c06-076-05.png	clear hiccup and falls flat on its back. This
data/c06/c06-076/c06-076-06.png	brilliant budge, I may add, gets no credit

data/c06/c06-128/c06-128-04.png	Bending over the cot, she suddenly realised

data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-02.png	was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-03.png	Congress, representing 800,000 organised
data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-04.png	trade unionists, when it decided by overwhelming
data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-05.png	votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-06.png	on unilateral disarmament, and to oppose
data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-07.png	Polaris and military bases being installed on
data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-08.png	the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-00.png	Such a policy would unite the whole movement
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-01.png	and lay the basis for the defeat of the
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-02.png	present Tory Government, which has become a
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-03.png	real menace to the British people both in
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-04.png	home and foreign policy. It is quite evident
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-05.png	that the movement will go on record against
data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-06.png	the Polaris base and facilities for German bases

data/c01/c01-066/c01-066-03.png	who had been close to him. In turning over
data/c01/c01-066/c01-066-04.png	the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought

data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-00.png	In 1950 he began to take photographs not

data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-02.png	America. An exhibition of these works which
data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-03.png	is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-04.png	pressive. As Friedrich Du&quot;rrenmatt, the Swiss
data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-05.png	playwright and author, wrote: &quot;Wicki's blacks
data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-06.png	and greys are not only the colours of the
data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-07.png	lost and the forgotten, but they are also the
data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-08.png	technical means of abstraction.
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-00.png	Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-01.png	considerable fidelity, the film tells the story
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-02.png	of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-03.png	table night club near his church be re-
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-04.png	moved. One night his prayer is answered
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-05.png	and the offending establishment is suddenly
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-06.png	transplanted to an island in the North Sea.
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-07.png	But Father Malachias's troubles have only
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-08.png	begun. Instead of having the desired effect,
data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-09.png	the miracle becomes exploited by a group
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-00.png	Every unnecessary detail, all superfluous local
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-01.png	colouring must be eliminated. He does not
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-02.png	want the accuracy of a police photograph,
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-03.png	but rather he wants to show the eternal in
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-04.png	every instant.&quot; The chilling horror of &quot;Mala-
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-05.png	chias&quot; is due as much to Wicki the photo-
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-06.png	grapher as to Wicki the director. His earlier
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-07.png	film, &quot;Die Bru&quot;cke,&quot; was equally terrifying,
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-08.png	but here the director moves out of the world
data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-09.png	of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-00.png	Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-01.png	the missing building. The Church rebukes the
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-02.png	poor monk for his miracle, and as a
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-03.png	crowning indignity the night club is
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-04.png	given a gala society reopening on the
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-05.png	island. Father Malachias goes to the island,
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-06.png	prays, and in a second miracle the
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-07.png	night club is replaced in its original
data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-08.png	setting.
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-00.png	When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-01.png	marvellous joke; no one has learned anything. Wicki
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-02.png	suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-03.png	complete silence he shows the faces of people
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-04.png	walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied,
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-05.png	and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-06.png	succeeded in his second film in
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-07.png	recording his personal apocalypse of the
data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-08.png	last days of a sick society.
data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-00.png	It is most unfair to call &quot;Malachias&quot; a cut-rate
data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-01.png	&quot;Dolce Vita,&quot; for it is far more intimate and deeply
data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-02.png	felt. In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-03.png	in &quot;Titanic&quot; by paralleling the last days of the
data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-04.png	Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner,
data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-05.png	and paid for his audacity with his life.
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-00.png	Strangely enough, the Berlin audience received
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-01.png	the film with extreme coolness, much preferring
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-02.png	Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing &quot;Une Femme
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-03.png	est une Femme,&quot; a ninety-one minute hymn
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-04.png	to &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Cahiers du Cinema,&quot; and the
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-05.png	worst aspects of the American cinema. From
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-06.png	a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-07.png	out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-08.png	and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-09.png	uninitiated (including four plugs for Charles
data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-10.png	Aznavour).
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-00.png	This director is at last being re-evaluated and
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-01.png	given his proper place in the history of the
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-02.png	German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-03.png	&quot;Unheimliche Geschichten&quot; (1920), five ghost stories
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-04.png	with a light touch, and there was much to admire
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-05.png	in &quot;Dreyfus&quot; (1930) and the virtually unknown
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-06.png	but extremely important &quot;1914&quot; (1931), which
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-07.png	tries to show that it took more than just
data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-08.png	Germany to start the First World War.
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-00.png	Belmondo reappears at the Paris Pullman
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-01.png	in Moderato Cantabile (curiously trans-

data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-03.png	A certificate), Peter Brook's film made
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-04.png	in France and shown last autumn at
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-05.png	the London Film Festival. In spite of
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-06.png	magnificent performances from him and
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-07.png	from Jeanne Moreau, this has been fairly
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-08.png	well trounced by the critics wherever it
data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-09.png	has appeared. Leisurely, even slow,
data/c02/c02-089/c02-089-00.png	With a large blond youth of quite
data/c02/c02-089/c02-089-01.png	dazzling dumbness called Troy
data/c02/c02-089/c02-089-02.png	Donahue; and Claudette Colbert, still
data/c02/c02-089/c02-089-03.png	charming amid the nonsense, and Karl
data/c02/c02-089/c02-089-04.png	Malden not knowing how to take it,
data/c02/c02-089/c02-089-05.png	all rolling eyeballs like a villain

data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-00.png	The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-01.png	play A Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-02.png	Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been produced
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-03.png	an directed by Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-04.png	part-author with Miss Delaney of the script,
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-05.png	and the great advantages to be derived from
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-06.png	this unity of conception and control are
data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-07.png	everywhere apparent.
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-01.png	conceived throughout in terms of the cinema,
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-02.png	and again and again it is the visual qualities
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-03.png	of the story, and the marriage of the central
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-04.png	characters to their background, which bring
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-05.png	the film so vividly to life. In Fanny, which
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-06.png	also has its premiere tomorrow, the director,
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-07.png	Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed to create
data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-08.png	the atmosphere of a city.
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-01.png	taken a town in the industrial North of England
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-02.png	and has made it live. The shabby streets and
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-03.png	wet pavements, the school play-grounds, the
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-04.png	public monuments and the rubbish strewn canals -
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-05.png	even the worn head-stones in the churchyard,
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-06.png	&quot;sacred to the memory of&quot; - are seen as an
data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-07.png	integral part of the story.
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-01.png	intense realism in the situation. A young
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-02.png	girl lives in a single dingy room with
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-03.png	her slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-04.png	surroundings she learns sex is something
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-05.png	sordid, and when she experiences it for the
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-06.png	first time herself it is incoherently, clumsily,
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-07.png	but half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-08.png	her first lover is a sailor who leaves her
data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-09.png	to bear his child and sails away.
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-01.png	an old man. Here it is a young homosexual,
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-02.png	estranged from women but yet moved by a
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-03.png	strong maternal instinct to the unborn child
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-04.png	as much as to the expectant mother, who acts
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-05.png	as a protector and comforter to her in her
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-06.png	hour of need. He shares her room and gives
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-07.png	her his forlorn gift of companionship and sym-
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-08.png	pathy - &quot;you need someone to love you while
data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-09.png	you are looking for someone to love&quot;.
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-01.png	technical error in allowing Irene to speak
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-02.png	for herself; we would be altogether clearer
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-03.png	in our minds about her if she remained
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-04.png	a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but not
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-05.png	heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-06.png	few brief scenes effective, and Mr. Dinsdale
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-07.png	Landen, in the longest and most exacting role,
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-08.png	that of the sergeant, gives a performance of
data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-09.png	rare intelligence and restrained power.
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-00.png	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-01.png	effective, giving full value to the formal elements
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-02.png	of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-03.png	them. Last night's play in the &quot;Play of the
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-04.png	Week&quot; series on independent television, Then
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-05.png	We Fall, by Mr. Paul Ferris, was a morality
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-06.png	on the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-07.png	power of unbridled ambition.
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-00.png	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-01.png	treatments of its subject by attempting to
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-02.png	generate a melodramatic inevitability which
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-03.png	left its central character and the world
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-04.png	around him in complete, unredeemable desolation.
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-05.png	We could, perhaps, say whether or not the attempt
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-06.png	succeeded if we had a little more faith in the
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-07.png	way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated his
data/c03/c03-087a/c03-087a-08.png	characters.
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-00.png	Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensi-

data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-02.png	always palely appealing, Mr. James Maxwell,
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-03.png	the editor, always comically abashed by the
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-04.png	events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the father-in-
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-05.png	law, always comically grotesque; they were
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-06.png	not asked to modulate from their set moods
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-07.png	but played with proper efficiency and, in
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-08.png	the case of Mr. Richards, with lavish and
data/c03/c03-094a/c03-094a-09.png	suitably gaudy colour.
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-01.png	explicably from appreciable motives. The rest,
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-02.png	one feels, were driven to effective action by
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-03.png	the author in spite of the ineffectuality
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-04.png	with which he had endowed them. One
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-05.png	hopes that he is not asking us to believe
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-06.png	that, because of their odd accents, they
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-07.png	act oddly like the queer foreigners of
data/c03/c03-096a/c03-096a-08.png	tradition.

data/c03/c03-007c/c03-007c-07.png	- are seen as an integral part of the
data/c03/c03-007c/c03-007c-08.png	story.
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-01.png	intense realism in the situation. A young
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-02.png	girl lives in a single dingy room with her
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-03.png	slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-04.png	surroundings she learns sex is something sordid,
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-05.png	and when she experiences it for the first time
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-06.png	herself it is incoherently, clumsily, but half
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-07.png	shyly and half inquisitively. As is the case in
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-08.png	Fanny her first lover is a sailor who leaves
data/c03/c03-016c/c03-016c-09.png	her to bear his child and sails away.
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-01.png	old man. Here it is a young homosexual, estranged
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-02.png	from women but yet moved by a strong maternal
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-03.png	instinct to the unborn child as much as to the
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-04.png	expectant mother, who acts as a protector and
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-05.png	comforter to her in her hour of need. He
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-06.png	shares her room and gives her his forlorn gift
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-07.png	of companionship and sympathy - &quot;you need someone
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-08.png	to love you while you are looking for
data/c03/c03-021c/c03-021c-09.png	someone to love&quot;.
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a technical
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-01.png	error in allowing Irene to speak for herself;
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-02.png	we would be altogether clearer in our minds
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-03.png	about her if she remained a flawed but beautiful
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-04.png	enigma, seen but not heard. However, Miss Pinkie
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-05.png	Johnstone makes her few brief scenes effective, and
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-06.png	Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in the longest and most
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-07.png	exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives a performance
data/c03/c03-081c/c03-081c-08.png	of rare intelligence and restrained power.
data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-00.png	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly effective,
data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-01.png	giving full value to the formal elements of Betti's
data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-02.png	writing without over-emphasizing them. Last night's

data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-05.png	was a morality on the not unfamiliar theme of
data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-06.png	the destructive power of unbridled ambition.
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-00.png	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most treatments
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-01.png	of its subject by attempting to generate a melo-
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-02.png	dramatic inevitability which left its central character
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-03.png	and the world around him in complete, unredee-
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-04.png	mable desolation. We could, perhaps, say whether
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-05.png	or not the attempt succeeded if we had a
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-06.png	little more faith in the way in which Mr.
data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-07.png	Ferris manipulated his characters.
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-00.png	Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensitively
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-01.png	pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife, always palely
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-02.png	appealing, Mr. James Maxwell, the editor, always
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-03.png	comically abashed by the events, and Mr. Aubrey
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-04.png	Richards, the father-in-law, always comically
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-05.png	grotesque; they were not asked to modulate from
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-06.png	their set moods but played with proper effi-
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-07.png	ciency and, in the case of Mr. Richards, with
data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-08.png	lavish and suitably gaudy colour.
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose explicably
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-01.png	from appreciable motives. The rest, one feels, were
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-02.png	driven to effective action by the author in spite
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-03.png	of the ineffectuality with which he had
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-04.png	endowed them. One hopes that he is not
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-05.png	asking us to believe that, because of their odd
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-06.png	accents, they act oddly like the queer foreigners
data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-07.png	of tradition.

data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived

data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-09.png	first lover is a sailor who leaves her to
data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-10.png	bear his child and sails away.
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-01.png	by an old man. Here it is a young homo-
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-02.png	sexual, estranged from women but yet moved
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-03.png	by a strong maternal instinct to the unborn
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-04.png	child as much as to the expectant mother,
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-05.png	who acts as a protector and comforter to
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-06.png	her in her hour of need. He shares her room
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-07.png	and gives her his forlorn gift of com-
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-08.png	panionship and sympathy - "you need someone
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-09.png	to love you while you are looking for
data/c03/c03-021e/c03-021e-10.png	someone to love".
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-01.png	technical error in allowing Irene to speak
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-02.png	for herself; we would be altogether clearer
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-03.png	in our minds about her if she remained
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-04.png	a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-05.png	not heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-06.png	makes her few brief scenes effective, and
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-07.png	Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in the longest and most
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-08.png	exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives a perfor-
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-09.png	mance of rare intelligence and restrained
data/c03/c03-081e/c03-081e-10.png	power.
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-00.png	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-01.png	effective, giving full value to the formal elements
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-02.png	of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-03.png	them. Last night's play in the &quot;Play of the
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-04.png	Week&quot; series on independent television, Then We
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-05.png	Fall, by Mr. Paul Ferris, was a morality on
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-06.png	the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
data/c03/c03-084e/c03-084e-07.png	power of unbridled ambition.
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-00.png	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-01.png	treatments of its subject by attempting to
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-02.png	generate a melodramatic inevitability
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-03.png	which left its central character and the world
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-04.png	around him in complete, unredeemable de-
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-05.png	solation. We could, perhaps, say whether or not
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-06.png	the attempt succeeded if we had a little more
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-07.png	faith in the way in which Mr. Ferris mani-
data/c03/c03-087e/c03-087e-08.png	pulated his characters.

data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-01.png	sitively pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife,

data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-03.png	the editor, always comically abashed by
data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-04.png	the events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the
data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-05.png	father-in-law, always comically grotesque;
data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-06.png	they were not asked to modulate from
data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-07.png	their set moods but played with proper
data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-08.png	efficiency and, in the case of Mr. Richards,
data/c03/c03-094e/c03-094e-09.png	with lavish and suitably gaudy colour.
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-01.png	explicably from appreciable motives. The
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-02.png	rest, one feels, were driven to effective action by
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-03.png	the author in spite of the ineffectuality with
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-04.png	which he had endowed them. One hopes that he
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-05.png	is not asking us to believe that, because of
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-06.png	their odd accents, they act oddly like the
data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-07.png	queer foreigners of tradition.
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-00.png	The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-01.png	play A Taste of Honey opens at the
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-02.png	Leicester Square Theatre tomorrow. It has
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-03.png	been produced and directed by Mr. Tony
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-04.png	Richardson, who is also part-author with
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-05.png	Miss Delaney of the script, and the great
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-06.png	advantages to be derived from this unity
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-07.png	of conception and control are everywhere
data/c03/c03-000f/c03-000f-08.png	apparent.
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been concei-
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-01.png	ved throughout in terms of the cinema,
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-02.png	and again and again it is the visual qualities
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-03.png	of the story, and the marriage of the
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-04.png	central characters to their background,
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-05.png	which bring the film so vividly to life. In
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-06.png	Fanny, which also has its premiere tomorrow,
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-07.png	the director, Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-08.png	but failed to create the atmosphere of
data/c03/c03-003f/c03-003f-09.png	a city.
data/c03/c03-007f/c03-007f-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
data/c03/c03-007f/c03-007f-01.png	taken a town in the industrial North of
data/c03/c03-007f/c03-007f-02.png	England and has made it live. The shabby
data/c03/c03-007f/c03-007f-03.png	streets and wet pavements, the school
data/c03/c03-007f/c03-007f-04.png	play-grounds, the public monuments and
data/c03/c03-007f/c03-007f-05.png	the rubbish strewn canals - even the worn

data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-00.png	NEXT month that friendly, effervescent performer Frankie
data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-01.png	Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage
data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-02.png	in a new show. To paraphrase his well-known ditty:
data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-03.png	&quot;He'll have the limelight, they'll give him the girls -
data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-04.png	and leave the rest to him.&quot;
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-00.png	I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-01.png	old, star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-02.png	Hollywood. His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-03.png	recently given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-04.png	treatment. But they haven't done a thing for his film
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-05.png	career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-06.png	doing better here, before the platinum-plated Hollywood
data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-07.png	carrot was dangled before his nose.
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-00.png	But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-01.png	for a new hit song. He might be well advised to
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-02.png	think hard and long before his next jump into the
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-03.png	Hollywood arena.
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-04.png	VERDICT: Vaughan should have by-passed this approach.
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-05.png	RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-06.png	Hollywood treatment, thanks to a sound performance in
data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-07.png	&quot;Taste of Fear&quot; (Warner Theatre, &quot;X&quot;).
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-00.png	Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-01.png	newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-02.png	loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-03.png	the river. The film starts off brightly enough but,
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-04.png	half-way through, the plot (as well as the boat) springs
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-05.png	a near-disastrous leak. Familiar members of Britain's
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-06.png	repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-07.png	equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.
data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-00.png	He has earned his break. The film is a well-made
data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-01.png	variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-02.png	try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind.
data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-03.png	Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-04.png	built up neatly. Susan Strasberg is the crippled
data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-05.png	damsel in distress.
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-00.png	Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-01.png	also effectively around. They provide some chilly red
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-02.png	herrings in this &quot;Find-the-body&quot; thriller. VERDICT:
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-03.png	Don't believe all you see and hear!
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-04.png	NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-05.png	James has pumped life into a slim, strained
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-06.png	comedy. He does his rescue act in &quot;Double Bunk&quot;
data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-07.png	(Leicester-square Theatre, &quot;A&quot;).
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-00.png	Their offering last night differed little
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-01.png	from their earlier act on this show a week
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-02.png	or so ago. But the Mudlarks, with Jeff Mudd
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-03.png	out of the Army and back with sister Mary
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-04.png	and brother Fred, were in bright, zestful
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-05.png	form. Why only two numbers, though? It
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-06.png	was not enough. &quot;A FAIR COP,&quot; the B B C
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-07.png	Whitehall farce last night, looked like
data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-08.png	a rabbit warren in a field of corn.
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-00.png	I can't recall a production where so many
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-01.png	comics bolted in and out of holes so often.
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-02.png	The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-03.png	lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-04.png	of his trousers. The action moved at tremendous
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-05.png	speed, backed by some wonderful timing by
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-06.png	the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-07.png	scene where six of the cast changed
data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-08.png	cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-00.png	Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-01.png	as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable. They
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-02.png	alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-03.png	through the gormless standing corn around them. Perhaps
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-04.png	it was accidental - I hope not. If ever a bag of
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-05.png	humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-06.png	farce is it when it comes to television.
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-00.png	HOW do you get on records? Well, you've got
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-01.png	to have something different. Sing slightly flat.
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-02.png	All the good singers sing in tune. Twang a guitar
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-03.png	slightly off key. Everybody's fed up with the
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-04.png	right way - so the best-seller charts say. Play
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-05.png	an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one. You got to
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-06.png	get it into your head, son... people
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-07.png	don't like things as they should be - not on
data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-08.png	record, anyway.
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-00.png	Thus, musician David Lisbon's chances of being a starred
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-01.png	disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-02.png	A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS. &quot;Why not,&quot; thought ex-soldier
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-03.png	Mr. Lisbon, who is twenty-three, and lives in Dagenham, Essex,
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-04.png	&quot;press a thumb-tack into the nose of the hammers that strike
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-05.png	the piano strings?&quot; He did, on his piano at home. There weren't
data/c04/c04-075/c04-075-06.png	enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done.
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-00.png	&quot;Let's have another song with a month in it,&quot; said Tolch. Mr.
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-01.png	Charles obliged with &quot;April Serenade.&quot; This week it appears, a
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-02.png	tuneful melody sung impeccably by Robert Earl (Philips). PRODUCER
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-03.png	Russell Turner, 33, provides his last programme for the B B C tonight
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-04.png	with Robert Harbin's &quot;Mystery and Magic&quot; (7.30). After six years
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-05.png	with the Corporation, during which he started &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; and
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-06.png	directed &quot;Six-Five Special,&quot; Turner is aiming to go into free-lance
data/c04/c04-122/c04-122-07.png	T V, film and stage production work.
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-00.png	Then he tried it out for sound. Um-chink...
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-01.png	um-chink... it went. Slightly flat and jangly in
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-02.png	part. DELIGHTFUL! He put the sound on tape. The
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-03.png	tape went to the Philips company. Within two
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-04.png	days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract. And they
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-05.png	hauled his thumb-tacked joanna the thirteen
data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-06.png	miles to London for his first session.
data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-00.png	"I feel I've done all I can at the B B C," he

data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-02.png	Mr. Lisbon has it taped. And tacked. And he says: &quot;Just as well
data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-03.png	I had only one box of tacks - it might have been so
data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-04.png	different....&quot; More news from the ivory-thumping dept....
data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-05.png	Russ Conway, who has tinkled his way to fame on an old 2pianna,

data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-00.png	But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY'S Russ
data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-01.png	Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But
data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-02.png	nothing crazy about his pianistics. He pounds merrily away
data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-03.png	at a piece called "Piccadilly" (Polydor). I find it cute.
data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-04.png	American pianist Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on "It's

data/c04/c04-139/c04-139-01.png	such as a chair and a motor-car. The idea is to see what happens when
data/c04/c04-139/c04-139-02.png	parts of the mind not normally available without hypnosis are used.
data/c04/c04-139/c04-139-03.png	I T V have postponed Malcolm Muggeridge's &quot;Appointment with

data/c04/c04-156/c04-156-00.png	It was a splendid interpretation of the
data/c04/c04-156/c04-156-01.png	part. The rest of the cast were well chosen,
data/c04/c04-156/c04-156-02.png	with James Maxwell making a fine job of the
data/c04/c04-156/c04-156-03.png	sympathetic C O. Paul Daneman gave another
data/c04/c04-156/c04-156-04.png	first-class performance last night as a

data/c04/c04-156/c04-156-06.png	&quot;The Little Key.&quot;
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-00.png	The play was no more than a figment of
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-01.png	the imagination which asked the viewer to
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-02.png	believe in a beautiful ghost. It would have been
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-03.png	an impossible piece of television but for clever
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-04.png	production by Michael Hayes. He captured
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-05.png	the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-06.png	effect. MORE than 100 viewers complained to
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-07.png	the B B C last night that an American film,
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-08.png	&quot;Britain - Blood, Sweat, and Tears... Plus
data/c04/c04-160/c04-160-09.png	Twenty Years,&quot; was anti-British.
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-00.png	The film replaced &quot;What's My Line?&quot; and &quot;Be My
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-01.png	Guest&quot; programmes because of an electricians'
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-02.png	strike. It showed Britain today through the eyes
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-03.png	of an American T V reporter, Eric Sevareid, and
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-04.png	British personalities. Among them - Professor
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-05.png	Dennis Brogan, Shelagh Delaney, and Alan Sillitoe.
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-06.png	The film covered a wide aspect of the British
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-07.png	scene, ranging from pubs, the Eton wall game,
data/c04/c04-165/c04-165-08.png	to the European Common Market.
data/c04/c04-170/c04-170-00.png	Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
data/c04/c04-170/c04-170-01.png	education. It was left to reporter Sevareid
data/c04/c04-170/c04-170-02.png	to make the strongest criticisms. He said
data/c04/c04-170/c04-170-03.png	that in the race of the modern nations,
data/c04/c04-170/c04-170-04.png	Britain was slipping behind....
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-00.png	It also parades Gina Lollobrigida in a selection of neglige*?
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-01.png	2e-and-nightie ensembles not too well designed for sleeping in,
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-02.png	and Rock Hudson at the wheel of a shining silver Rolls-Royce.
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-03.png	Mr. Hudson is an American millionaire who spends each
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-04.png	September in his Italian villa and the company of Signorina
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-05.png	Lollobrigida. In the holiday seasonal months before and
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-06.png	after this annual idyll his major-domo (Walter Slezak
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-07.png	at his most nauseating) turns the palazzo into a luxury
data/c06/c06-083/c06-083-08.png	hotel.
data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-00.png	A little more honesty, even if one refrains from going into
data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-01.png	too many details, would help many a child to make a
data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-02.png	proper adjustment to life as it grows up. Let us look
data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-03.png	at Jesus. We do not, I think, see there a life without fear.
data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-04.png	There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-05.png	on.
data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-00.png	Amen. MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-01.png	purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only
data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-02.png	partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-03.png	amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be
data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-04.png	effective, must be of that child-like quality which comes
data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-05.png	from innocence.
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-00.png	Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-01.png	until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-02.png	attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-03.png	with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-04.png	disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-05.png	of fatigue. They wonder why they get no rest at night,
data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-06.png	even if they do sleep.
data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-00.png	If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-01.png	we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-02.png	staggered. Some of it is inevitable, and we do not want to
data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-03.png	become too pernickety. Nevertheless, we could all probably
data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-04.png	be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-05.png	through.
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-00.png	The bar was the commonest marking, but others
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-01.png	were also used. Dots sometimes served in place of the
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-02.png	bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-03.png	it is now used to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-04.png	paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H. Roberts is of
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-05.png	the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-06.png	some markings would be used, although which, it is
data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-07.png	impossible to say.
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-00.png	Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-01.png	the original of the Gospel would be unmarked. The
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-02.png	original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-03.png	whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-04.png	columns. This is the invariable practice of ancient
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-05.png	manuscripts. A common size of column would hold
data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-06.png	about one third of a page of Souter's print.
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-00.png	The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-01.png	and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-02.png	a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-03.png	which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-04.png	this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-05.png	was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-06.png	an easy form of book in which to find a
data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-07.png	reference.
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-00.png	This last objection might have had some weight in
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-01.png	ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13.11-12,
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-02.png	the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-03.png	As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-04.png	overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-05.png	information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-06.png	The other form of book was the codex. In this the
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-07.png	sheets were bound together down one edge much as
data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-08.png	they are in modern books.
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-00.png	The action of the Shamir writes books and their
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-01.png	books are readable. This Shamir is indeed a rare
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-02.png	diamond that incises the hardest rock, the hardest
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-03.png	facts. And these creatures existed from the
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-04.png	beginning. It is &quot;the stone, which the builders
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-05.png	refused, but it is to become the head-stone
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-06.png	of the corner&quot;. (Ps. 118, 22.) And the stone shall
data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-07.png	tell!
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-00.png	&quot;For the stone shall cry out of the wall&quot;, like
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-01.png	Baalam's ass, &quot;and the purlin of timber shall
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-02.png	creak in answer&quot; &quot;if the roof of our security is
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-03.png	crushing our soul&quot; (see Hab. 2, 10-11). And it is
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-04.png	through the Shamir: &quot;That the earth shall be
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-05.png	filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-06.png	Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; (Hab. 2, 14.)
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-00.png	Under such conditions without putting your
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-01.png	mind together we cannot solve the further
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-02.png	summons of destiny, to solve the economic
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-03.png	problems. Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-04.png	Jochai (Tanis 6a) &quot;if Israel does not fulfil
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-05.png	the wish of the Lord, failing to serve the
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-06.png	Lord God with all their visionary power,
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-07.png	the work will have to be done by each
data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-08.png	individual&quot;.
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-00.png	Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-01.png	freedom from fear, fear of starvation in the
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-02.png	midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forth-
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-03.png	coming for the people in need. They will
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-04.png	think of the animals first (which is of course
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-05.png	our duty). Of course the individual will
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-06.png	eat and be full but: &quot;Take heed to yourself,
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-07.png	that your heart be not deceived, and 1ye turn
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-08.png	aside, and serve other gods, and worship them&quot;,
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-09.png	the yourself is thy greatest enemy, the self-
data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-10.png	seeking self.
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-00.png	And you serve Mammon and God. And you cannot serve
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-01.png	two masters, and you worship self-interest, isolating
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-02.png	yourself, under such conditions the goods are your gods.
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-03.png	&quot;And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-04.png	shut up the heavens, that there is no rain, and that the land
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-05.png	yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-06.png	good land which the Lord 1giveth you.&quot;
data/d04/d04-062/d04-062-00.png	For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
data/d04/d04-062/d04-062-01.png	your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
data/d04/d04-062/d04-062-02.png	the problem of life cannot be solved. &quot;Therefore shall 1ye lay
data/d04/d04-062/d04-062-03.png	up these my words in your heart and in your soul.&quot; The text
data/d04/d04-062/d04-062-04.png	adds and in your soul, searching your soul.
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-00.png	And the sequence in the text is different than
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-01.png	in the first part of the Shmah, we have first &quot;and
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-02.png	to bind them for a sign upon your hand, that
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-03.png	they may be as frontlets between your eyes.&quot; First to
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-04.png	bind them to have the vision and then &quot;And 1ye
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-05.png	shall teach them to your children.&quot; And as we have go-
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-06.png	ne through the mill, we need not teach them
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-07.png	to the children any more diligently and the
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-08.png	children will grasp now what will befall
data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-09.png	them without visionary power.
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-00.png	And we will nail the Divine Law on the
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-01.png	door posts of the house and upon the gates.
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-02.png	"That your days may be multiplied and the
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-03.png	days of your children in the land, which
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-04.png	the Lord swear unto your father to give them,
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-05.png	as days of HEAVEN ON EARTH" That
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-06.png	means the Kingdom of Messianic Righteousness
data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-07.png	(Talmud Sanh. 99A).
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-00.png	The Messusah, which is nailed on the doorposts
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-01.png	contains those two lessons. The third lesson
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-02.png	of the Shmah (Numbers 15, 37-41) is
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-03.png	called &quot;the going-out of the land of
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-04.png	Egypt&quot;. It starts with the story of the fringes
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-05.png	the &quot;tsitsits&quot;. This lesson used to be read
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-06.png	only in the morning. And the Talmud tells a
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-07.png	story, which is also in the Hagadah that
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-08.png	Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said, &quot;I am
data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-09.png	nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-00.png	Ben Zoma said: "The days of 1thy life
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-01.png	means in the day-time; all the days of
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-02.png	1thy life means even at night-time."
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-03.png	(Berochoth.) And the Rabbis thought
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-04.png	it important that when we read the
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-05.png	Shmah "to be willing to hear," we
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-06.png	should remember the Great
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-07.png	Deliverance: Passover and its connection
data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-08.png	with the fringes (the tsitsits).
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-00.png	At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-01.png	was able to identify a photograph of the
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-02.png	girl, and he said he had last seen her
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-03.png	on platform six waiting to board
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-04.png	a train for the short run to Victoria.
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-05.png	A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-06.png	a young lady &quot;as near as possible&quot;
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-07.png	like the photograph shown him, with
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-08.png	a man &quot;very close in conversation and
data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-09.png	walking arm in arm.&quot;
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-00.png	A guard reported that at East Croydon
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-01.png	he had seen what was accepted as the
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-02.png	same couple sitting close together in
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-03.png	a first-class compartment of the
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-04.png	train from London Bridge of which
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-05.png	he was in charge. The two could
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-06.png	have joined this train by taking
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-07.png	one from Victoria and changing
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-08.png	at East Croydon. He also believed
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-09.png	that they had still been together at
data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-10.png	South Croydon, and he remembered
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-00.png	Medical evidence established that Mary
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-01.png	Money had been dead for about an
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-02.png	hour before her body was discovered,
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-03.png	and this matched reasonably well with
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-04.png	the timetable of the train in question.
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-05.png	More important evidence came from a
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-06.png	signalman at Purley Oaks, who had
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-07.png	seen, as the train passed his box, a
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-08.png	couple struggling in a first-class
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-09.png	compartment; but he seemed to have
data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-10.png	been used to seeing couples engaged in
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-00.png	(1) Matzo represents Peshat; (2) Moraur
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-01.png	represents Remez; (3) Dipping-in represents
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-02.png	Derush; (4) Leaning-back represents Saud.
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-03.png	(This is the PARDUS.) Matzo represents
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-04.png	the literal meaning of Pesach which
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-05.png	is called: The Feast of Matzos. The
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-06.png	Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-07.png	principle and this gives us &quot;a wink&quot; (Remez)
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-08.png	how to live and accept all the bitterness
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-09.png	that is hurled against us. The Salt-water
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-10.png	and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-11.png	the richness of the Law and that we should
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-00.png	Leaning back carries the concealed message. And we
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-01.png	start the Seder showing the Matzos, that they rep-
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-02.png	resent the &quot;Bread of Poverty&quot; which our fore-fathers
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-03.png	were eating in Mitzrajim, to show they were willing to learn;
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-04.png	and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-05.png	discussions, saying: &quot;Anybody who is hungry, let him come
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-06.png	and eat, Anybody who is thirsty, let him come and
data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-07.png	drink.&quot;
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-00.png	And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-01.png	four ways of Israel's redemption. Hence &quot;four questions&quot;, which are
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-02.png	really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re-
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-03.png	demptions are asked at the Seder-evening about these &quot;four
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-04.png	symbols&quot; (the MANISHTANO). And the person who asks these
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-05.png	questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is
data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-06.png	conducting the Seder.
data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-00.png	And we answer, that the Lord our God gave us &quot;four freedoms&quot;
data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-01.png	without which Society cannot make progress. And we drink
data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-02.png	&quot;four cups&quot; to thank the Lord our God for the &quot;four
data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-03.png	freedoms&quot; which are Divine. There are four ways of
data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-04.png	redemption: (1) I will bring you out from under the
data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-05.png	burdens of Egypt. (2) I will rid you of their bondage.
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-00.png	(3) I will redeem you. (4) I will take you to me for a
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-01.png	people. (1) I will bring you out from under the
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-02.png	burdens of Egypt: How was it that Israel was
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-03.png	brought out from under the burdens of Egypt?
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-04.png	Because, they kept the Passover and they were
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-05.png	eating Matzos in Egypt and the &quot;Feast of Matzos&quot;
data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-06.png	was known even to Abraham and Lot.
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-00.png	They objected to the word Absolution. So the phrase 'or
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-01.png	the remission of sins' was added. But Absolution remained.
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-02.png	They objected to the word Confirmation. So the phrase
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-03.png	'or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-04.png	able to render an account of their faith according
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-05.png	to the Catechism following' were added. But Confirmation
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-06.png	remained. Other changes in the Book were equally
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-07.png	minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-08.png	added to the Catechism.
data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-00.png	Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church?
data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-01.png	Laud made a positive approach. He set out to increase
data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-02.png	a sense of reverence. The Prayer Book was to be respected
data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-03.png	and so was the office of a bishop. Altars should be
data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-04.png	altars and not any broken down, transportable
data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-05.png	table which was handy for the most improbable uses.
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-00.png	In the first place it is not a great deal
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-01.png	of use telling even children, as I have
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-02.png	already suggested, not to be silly or
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-03.png	to pull themselves together. Far better
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-04.png	to help them to face whatever it is that
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-05.png	is worrying them, to find the original
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-06.png	cause and then deal with it; show it
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-07.png	up either for the sham it is - and many
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-08.png	fears are based upon completely
data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-09.png	irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-00.png	There may be some who will argue that
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-01.png	routine destroys the soul. It is so easy,
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-02.png	they say, to get into a rut. Save us
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-03.png	from the school curriculum and even
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-04.png	worse the school system whereby for
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-05.png	meals everybody knows beforehand
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-06.png	exactly what, on any given day of the
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-07.png	week, they are going to have. If - such
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-08.png	a critic may say - you are calling
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-09.png	us to adventure, do not strangle us before
data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-10.png	we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-00.png	The effect of bottom congestion due to
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-01.png	the light pressure is inevitably mixed
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-02.png	with that of the suitability of ground
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-03.png	for spawning. Both result in crowding,
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-04.png	so there is no need to try to separate
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-05.png	them - thank Heaven! A good picture of
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-06.png	this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-07.png	grounds from the Viking in the north down

data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-00.png	The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82)
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-01.png	has always differed from that of the
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-02.png	summer fisheries. There is the &quot;swim&quot;
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-03.png	at slack waters, even in daylight
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-04.png	sometimes; and the high swimming,
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-05.png	when fish are caught only in the top
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-06.png	few yards of netting. These and other
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-07.png	fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-08.png	to this fishery, which unfortunately seems
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-09.png	to be dying out; but a full discussion of
data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-10.png	them is beyond the present scope.
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-00.png	The Bow-wave Theory. This assumes
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-01.png	that all fishing gear, when moving,
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-02.png	sends before it a kind of scaring effect,
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-03.png	probably through waves or vibrations in
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-04.png	the water or along the ground.
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-05.png	Underwater films suggest that the
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-06.png	footrope of a trawl does this. Films
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-07.png	have also shown plaice moving before
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-08.png	a seine net in just the same way after
data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-09.png	being gathered inwards by the ropes.
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-00.png	Because situations which may contain
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-01.png	all the elements of fear can arise suddenly,
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-02.png	it is a good idea to condition a child
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-03.png	to some extent against it. To keep a child
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-04.png	of twelve or thirteen under the
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-05.png	impression that nothing nasty ever
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-06.png	happens is not merely dishonest, it
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-07.png	is unwise. As I shall suggest in a
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-08.png	later chapter there are some situations
data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-09.png	which occur less frequently than
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-00.png	It was a little complicated to work,
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-01.png	of course, and there had to be a big
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-02.png	notice in the entrance saying which
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-03.png	day of the timetable it was - but
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-04.png	it added immensely to the interest
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-05.png	and kept everybody on their toes.
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-06.png	To have order does not mean getting
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-07.png	into a dull routine. I have great
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-08.png	sympathy with the young wife
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-09.png	who does not always want to do
data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-10.png	the washing on a Monday.
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-00.png	Thus we can see that herring
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-01.png	movements, although primarily
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-02.png	instinctive perhaps, and certainly
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-03.png	helped and hindered by water flow,
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-04.png	are also closely related to the sea-bed
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-05.png	geography. Geography, too, names the
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-06.png	great fisheries that depend on them:
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-07.png	the Fladen Ground (where again most big
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-08.png	shots are taken on the edges), the Gut,
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-09.png	a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-10.png	the herring spawn along the northern
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-00.png	The joint evidence of echo-sounders
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-01.png	and fishing gear leads to an overall
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-02.png	though somewhat dim picture.
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-03.png	The details are harder still to see.
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-04.png	Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance,
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-05.png	shoals that gather at the Knoll or
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-06.png	other banks are most of them
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-07.png	going to travel a hundred
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-08.png	miles farther south before they
data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-09.png	spawn. Some will spawn at the
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-00.png	Easterly winds, on the other hand,
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-01.png	mean no herring along the shore, as
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-02.png	recent years have shown. A succession
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-03.png	of winds is needed for this effect of
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-04.png	course - one breeze will not do it,
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-05.png	though a very hard westerly will
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-06.png	often start off the "local" herring;
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-07.png	but quite apart from this wind effect
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-08.png	there is an easterly drift special
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-09.png	to this rump of coastline, caused by
data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-10.png	the meeting of water from north and south.
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-00.png	...Today A wonderful thought In the
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-01.png	dawn was given... And the thought
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-02.png	Was this: That a secret plan Is hid in
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-03.png	my hand; That my hand is big Big,
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-04.png	Because of the plan That God, Who
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-05.png	dwells in my hand, Knows this
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-06.png	secret plan, Of the things He will
data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-07.png	do for the world Using my hand.
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-00.png	In other ways, too, life for the ordinary
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-01.png	individual has become so complex
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-02.png	that it taxes the mind. Two hundred
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-03.png	years ago, men lived and worked
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-04.png	in one place, their lives were of one
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-05.png	piece. Now a man may live twenty,
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-06.png	thirty even sixty miles from his
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-07.png	work. The only connexion is the
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-08.png	pipeline of the railway on which they
data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-09.png	travel day by day.
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-00.png	They only worked, of course, a five-
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-01.png	day week so that in the first week
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-02.png	Monday to Friday were days one
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-03.png	to five of the timetable, the following
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-04.png	Monday was day six and Tuesday
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-05.png	started day one again and so on.
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-06.png	By this means they avoided each
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-07.png	week being the same with a pupil
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-08.png	knowing exactly what the subject
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-09.png	would be on Friday afternoon at
data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-10.png	3 p.m..
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-00.png	Drift in another form probably
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-01.png	explains how these migrating herring
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-02.png	are biased to east or west by the
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-03.png	different winds. Strong westerlies
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-04.png	are well known to bring good
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-05.png	longshore fishings. The surface
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-06.png	water that is blown offshore must
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-07.png	be replaced by an underflow bringing
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-08.png	with it the herring to the Norfolk
data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-09.png	and Suffolk beaches.
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-00.png	Let us consider first what would
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-01.png	appear to be the simplest case -
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-02.png	that of flat fish on the bottom.
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-03.png	The evidence suggest that the fish are
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-04.png	aware of the moving footrope before
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-05.png	it reaches them. They move away before
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-06.png	it, swimming at the same speed
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-07.png	for an unknown period of time, until
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-08.png	they become (1) tired, or (2) more used
data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-09.png	to the disturbance.
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-00.png	Toyohiko Kagawa. Loving Saviour, who experienced
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-01.png	all human emotion, and whose sensitive
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-02.png	nature knows better than we do, what it is to
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-03.png	be really afraid, help us to know that when
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-04.png	we face life boldly, many of the shadows are
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-05.png	seen to be allies and not enemies and that,
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-06.png	come what may, we are never alone when
data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-07.png	we are with Thee.
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-00.png	They drag themselves around and can become
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-01.png	a burden to their families and their friends.
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-02.png	Any mental confusion can cause this and
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-03.png	the best way is probably to seek advice.
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-04.png	As we are unable to cure our own bodies
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-05.png	if the cause of our pain is too deep seated,
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-06.png	so we are unable to cure our own minds,
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-07.png	if the trouble is a complicated one
data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-08.png	involving careful and patient treatment.
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-00.png	I am more than conscious of this. How anybody
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-01.png	can go through the same routine day in and day
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-02.png	out for forty years I find difficult to understand.
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-03.png	A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-04.png	commerce may be kept going - though if ever
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-05.png	it becomes possible to work out a system
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-06.png	of 'staggered' hours it may do an immense
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-07.png	amount of good over and above relieving
data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-08.png	the pressure on over-crowded trains.
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-00.png	This could hardly happen without the
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-01.png	herring having some orientation with the
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-02.png	sea bottom. It means that the crowding
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-03.png	is caused during the daytime, and that
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-04.png	the herring must continue to migrate over
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-05.png	the ground as well as in midwater and
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-06.png	during the swim (the swim at East Anglia
data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-07.png	is always from the north).
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-00.png	So the arrival of any particular shoal
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-01.png	fish at a certain spawning ground may
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-02.png	be accidental. Yet there will always be some
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-03.png	that find it if enough are travelling, just as
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-04.png	the robin who gets back exactly may be
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-05.png	only one among thousands who do not.
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-06.png	But this southerly migration is not
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-07.png	accidental. Being contranatant or against
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-08.png	the drift, it probably has a survival value
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-09.png	in ensuring that the fry after hatching
data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-10.png	are drifted back into the normal home
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-00.png	To others, the long hours of the night bring
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-01.png	only a disturbed tossing and turning
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-02.png	which causes them to wake feeling worse
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-03.png	than when they went to bed. We may begin
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-04.png	to understand this a little better when we
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-05.png	realize that tiredness itself is largely in
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-06.png	the mind. Very few people, under normal
data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-07.png	conditions, work themselves to a standstill.
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-00.png	In many cases, their homes know little of
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-01.png	their place of work and their associates at
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-02.png	the office or works wonder what they
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-03.png	are possibly like in the surroundings of their
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-04.png	homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-05.png	a 'double' life without ever deliberately
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-06.png	planning to do so or in fact being conscious
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-07.png	of what is going on. It is easier to live life in
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-08.png	compartments but over the years it builds up,
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-09.png	and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-10.png	need to be handled correctly.
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-00.png	As it is, with so much of our life already
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-01.png	in a predetermined groove, I would
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-02.png	hardly like to add further to the dullness
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-03.png	which it engenders. But I am not arguing
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-04.png	for this. I know how much of a drag it can be
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-05.png	and I was interested some little while
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-06.png	ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-07.png	day timetable.
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-00.png	Herring fishermen call this &quot;the outset&quot;. It
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-01.png	is strongest at spring tides, when without
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-02.png	wind you will &quot;set&quot; out - or drift to the east-
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-03.png	ward, the length of half a fleet of nets -
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-04.png	almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-05.png	Knoll. Without an explanation of how it
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-06.png	works, it may well be that this outset, akin
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-07.png	to the mouth of a great salmon river, has
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-08.png	been the biggest factor through the ages
data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-09.png	in the constancy of this great herring fishery.
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-00.png	Actually the seine net has little or no cover.
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-01.png	And in this film the rise of the fish was
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-02.png	small, a matter of a foot or two. With round
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-03.png	fish like haddock, which would hardly
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-04.png	find safety on the bottom, this cover
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-05.png	would seem to be even more essential;
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-06.png	but more films are needed to prove this.
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-07.png	Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-08.png	essential to catch round fish whose
data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-09.png	reaction to disturbance would be upwards.
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-00.png	We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-01.png	that he was a great man for lace - paying
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-02.png	as much as 3 for a lace collar. But this
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-03.png	didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-04.png	for his lady, for he records testily: 'My wife
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-05.png	and I fell out about my not being willing
data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-06.png	to have her gown laced.'
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-00.png	We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-01.png	reign of Charles 2 stating: 'Lost: a lawn 1hand-
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-02.png	kercher with a broad hem laced round with
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-03.png	fine Point lace about four fingers broad' and
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-04.png	among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-05.png	unpaid bill for 'scarlet satin shoes with
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-06.png	silver lace'. The records of these tender trifles
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-07.png	are very touching but then lace does place
data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-08.png	upon everything a delicate sentiment.
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-00.png	Lucky indeed are the families that
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-01.png	possess a heritage of lace. A lace
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-02.png	bridal veil handed down from mother
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-03.png	to daughters, a lace-trimmed Christening
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-04.png	robe that each generation wears in turn -
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-05.png	these are proud possessions, linked to the
data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-06.png	exquisite lace-making of the past.
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-00.png	But lace-making is by no means a lost
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-01.png	art. It suffered a decline and fell into
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-02.png	lamentably low standards in the fussy
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-03.png	over-furnishing of the Victorian age
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-04.png	but it would take more than a temporary
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-05.png	lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely,
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-06.png	viable craft. It has, in fact, readily
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-07.png	adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-08.png	ustrations in the following pages will show
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-09.png	how completely it is in sympathy with con-
data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-10.png	temporary surroundings.
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-00.png	It will be seen how, with bold design
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-01.png	and rich colour, knitting, crochet and
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-02.png	tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-03.png	can give striking individuality to many things
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-04.png	in the home. Chairbacks, cushions, tablecloths,
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-05.png	to mention only three - how satisfying it is
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-06.png	to avoid the ready-made in these and by
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-07.png	one's own handiwork produce something
data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-08.png	that reflects true creative talent.
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-00.png	The more delicate patterns and finer
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-01.png	threads may be reserved to bring a light
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-02.png	and lovely touch to personal possessions -
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-03.png	a lace border to a handkerchief, fine-lace
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-04.png	insertion on a petticoat or blouse, a tatted edge
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-05.png	to a collar; these add a charming, feminine
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-06.png	distinction that nothing else can give.
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-07.png	Although we assess lace-making as one of
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-08.png	the feminine skills, a number of the well-loved
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-09.png	traditional patterns that we follow today were,
data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-10.png	in fact, the brain-children of inventive men.
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-00.png	For in the old order of things, men designed
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-01.png	and worked lace as well as women and
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-02.png	special schools were set up to teach lace-
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-03.png	making not only to young girls, but to little
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-04.png	boys as well. Whole families made their
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-05.png	livelihood by lace-making and consequently
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-06.png	a folklore of song, festival and courtship grew
data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-07.png	up around the lace industry.
data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-00.png	First launder crochet and then pin to the required
data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-01.png	shape, ensuring that all lines of the crochet are
data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-02.png	accurate. Place crochet in correct position on linen and
data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-03.png	secure with pins. Run a line of basting stitches
data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-04.png	on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-05.png	which are to be attached to the linen. Remove crochet.
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-00.png	Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen:
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-01.png	(a) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches,
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-02.png	the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-03.png	outside edge. Oversew crochet to button stitch.
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-04.png	(b) Turn under a small hem, with fold lying on line
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-05.png	of basting stitches. Work a row of dc all round
data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-06.png	this hem, with 3 dc at each corner.
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-00.png	Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-01.png	size of thread. To ensure the correct results,
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-02.png	it is important that you use the size of hook
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-03.png	specified in the directions. These are the
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-04.png	correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet:
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-05.png	Directions are given for a small practice
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-06.png	piece for each stitch that you learn. When
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-07.png	you have become proficient in these
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-08.png	stitches, attractive articles can be made
data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-09.png	from the directions included in this book.
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-00.png	1. Grasp thread near end between thumb
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-01.png	and forefinger. 2. Make a loop by
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-02.png	lapping long thread over short thread.
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-03.png	3. Hold loop in place between thumb
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-04.png	and forefinger (Fig. 1). 1. Take hold
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-05.png	of broad bar of hook as you would a
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-06.png	pencil. Bring middle finger forward to
data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-07.png	rest near tip of hook.
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-00.png	2. Insert hook through loop and under long
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-01.png	thread. Catch long end of thread (Fig. 2).
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-02.png	Draw loop through. 3. Do not remove hook
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-03.png	from thread. Pull short end and ball thread
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-04.png	in opposite directions to bring loop close around
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-05.png	the end of the hook, but not too tight
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-06.png	(Fig. 3). Loop thread round little finger,
data/e01/e01-119/e01-119-07.png	across palm and behind forefinger (Fig. 4).
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-00.png	This is what I mean by &quot;getting things the wrong way
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-01.png	round&quot;. He is far more likely to find out about how
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-02.png	his own mind works by looking at other people's.
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-03.png	For although looking inwards (or &quot;introspecting&quot;
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-04.png	as it is called), is not entirely ruled out,
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-05.png	nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-06.png	one of the most unreliable methods of getting
data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-07.png	any precise information.
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-00.png	A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-01.png	imprisoned in England. His son, in revenge, was
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-02.png	harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg,
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-03.png	and doing it to some purpose. John Philpot,
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-04.png	one of that new class of merchant financiers
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-05.png	which the city of London was now producing, fitted,
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-06.png	equipped and manned a fleet from his own
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-07.png	resources, and captured the young Mercer in a
data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-08.png	brilliant Channel fight.
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-00.png	A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-01.png	legs, and in reproduction period pieces they
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-02.png	are frequently used. The simpler varieties are
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-03.png	extremely easy to work, the four sides being
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-04.png	simply planed to give the required taper. In
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-05.png	the more elaborate varieties, however, a toe is
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-06.png	worked in the solid, and this certainly
data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-07.png	complicates the operation.
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-00.png	For short ones a smoothing plane can be used.
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-01.png	The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-02.png	on the newly planed surfaces, and these treated
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-03.png	as before. It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-04.png	the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-05.png	of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-06.png	straight.
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-00.png	A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-01.png	end reveals when the required amount
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-02.png	has been removed, and if care is taken
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-03.png	to stop the plane short of the squared
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-04.png	pencil line at the top, the work will be
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-05.png	accurate. The straight-edge can be used
data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-06.png	to test the straightness of the sides.
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-00.png	Incidentally, it is better to
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-01.png	complete any mortising that may be
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-02.png	needed at the top before the tapering is
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-03.png	begun. Some plain tapered legs have
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-04.png	the taper on the two inner faces only,
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-05.png	the outer surfaces being vertical as
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-06.png	at (B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-07.png	that at (D), Fig. 1, the square is first
data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-08.png	marked out as at (A), Fig. 3.
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-00.png	But why woodwork in particular? Well, there
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-01.png	are many reasons. Wood is in good and
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-02.png	common supply; it lends itself to making
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-03.png	innumerable useful household items -
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-04.png	furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-05.png	it enables results to be obtained fairly
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-06.png	quickly; it is less expensive than most
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-07.png	other materials; it is a pleasant material
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-08.png	to work with; and, although it does
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-09.png	create a certain amount of mess, it is
data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-10.png	all clean and easily cleared away.
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-00.png	Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-01.png	with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-02.png	most men have some of the tools already. It will enable
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-03.png	a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-04.png	any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-05.png	which other tools can be added as the need arises. The
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-06.png	nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-07.png	to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-08.png	which increases the range of things that can be
data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-09.png	made enormously.
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-00.png	As a still further development, we follow
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-01.png	with a good basic kit, which includes
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-02.png	the fuller kit (which in its turn, of course,
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-03.png	includes the bare minimum kit).
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-04.png	With this the vast majority of jobs
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-05.png	can be done, though for advanced
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-06.png	cabinet work the necessity for
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-07.png	certain special tools will become
data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-08.png	obvious.
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-00.png	Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-01.png	machines, the choice of which will
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-02.png	depend partly upon the space available
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-03.png	in the workshop, the amount one
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-04.png	is prepared to pay, and the type of
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-05.png	work a man normally does. First,
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-06.png	however, a word of advice generally.
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-07.png	Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-08.png	machines. They never are cheap in the
data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-09.png	long run. They may be inaccurate,
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-00.png	Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-01.png	in design or quality soon become apparent. It is far
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-02.png	better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-03.png	quality, and not handicap yourself from the start.
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-04.png	To put it in a slightly different way, do not allow
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-05.png	yourself to blame the tools when the job does
data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-06.png	not turn out quite right!
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-00.png	Many men with only limited accommodation
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-01.png	have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table.
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-02.png	Providing this is sound, some perfectly good
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-03.png	work can be done on it, but the usual problems
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-04.png	are those of the vice, the bench stop, and storage
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-05.png	place for tools. The combined bench top and
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-06.png	tool cupboard shown here has been specially
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-07.png	designed and made for WOODWORKER
data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-08.png	readers who have this difficulty.
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-00.png	See Fig. 2. These are then glued and
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-01.png	pinned into place. A similar piece of 1 in.
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-02.png	by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-03.png	the end of the feeding tray as seen in
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-04.png	Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-05.png	hardboard is covered with plastic material
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-06.png	for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-07.png	the frame with panel pins to complete
data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-08.png	the feeding tray.
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-00.png	Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-01.png	fits up against the front legs of the
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-02.png	chair. The seat rests across the upper two
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-03.png	cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-04.png	glued and panel pinned in position, measurements
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-05.png	being taken directly from the work. Fig. 4
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-06.png	shows the framework for the back which
data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-07.png	is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber.
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-00.png	Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-01.png	screws driven from the inside. The footrest is a
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-02.png	piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-03.png	by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-04.png	of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5. When determining
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-05.png	the position of the footrest, do not place too near
data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-06.png	the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs.
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-00.png	To complete the job, screw two fittings to the
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-01.png	inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-02.png	back to hold the baby's safety harness. These can be
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-03.png	made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-04.png	wire as shown in Fig. 6. Make sure that these
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-05.png	are well secured as they will have to withstand
data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-06.png	considerable pulling as the child becomes older.
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-00.png	Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-01.png	with plastic wood. Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-02.png	framework and round off any sharp edges (such as the
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-03.png	edge of the seat, feeding tray, etc). Fill the grain with a
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-04.png	woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-05.png	a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-06.png	for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-07.png	a suitable nursery transfer.
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-00.png	Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-01.png	if junior decides to bite the chair. Finally, it is as well
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-02.png	to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-03.png	material that might be available as otherwise the
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-04.png	paint would soon be scratched off.
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-05.png	(J.H.P.) BUILDING your own boat is a most
data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-06.png	satisfying and worthwhile project.
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-00.png	Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-01.png	rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-02.png	sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-03.png	construction, cheapness and lightness of weight,
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-04.png	and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-05.png	weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-06.png	and an outboard motor with a comfortable
data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-07.png	margin of freeboard.
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-00.png	For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-01.png	in place of screws. We just bend them over and clamp
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-02.png	firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I've
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-03.png	always used brass screws, which are more expensive. The first
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-04.png	job is to make your moulds. In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply,
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-05.png	but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-06.png	is nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked
data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-07.png	and cut to shape later.
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-00.png	If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-01.png	the moulds, make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-02.png	Fig. 2. The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-03.png	rigid as possible, for it is on these you will be building
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-04.png	and shaping your little craft, upside-down. For cheapness
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-05.png	I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-06.png	Columbia.
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-00.png	This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-01.png	a permanently water proof glue line. Be sure to
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-02.png	see that the edge bears the mark, P.M.B.C. Exterior.
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-03.png	This may be bought at any good timber merchants.
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-04.png	The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-05.png	wood of the same make, or oak or mahogany. For the
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-06.png	last one I made, I used the two flaps from an old
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-07.png	mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-08.png	shilling.
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-00.png	I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-01.png	rowing this dinghy (Fig. 3). They are very simple, cheap
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-02.png	and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-03.png	there is only a single gunwale on the outside.
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-04.png	I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-05.png	is difficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome
data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-06.png	this in another way as shown in Fig. 4.
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-00.png	Cut the moulds and the
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-01.png	transoms to shape as in the
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-02.png	detailed drawings. If you have
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-03.png	a wooden floor you can use
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-04.png	'A' frames fastened to the floor
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-05.png	if not, use a strong horizontal
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-06.png	frame that will sit firmly on
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-07.png	the ground or concrete floor. I
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-08.png	use a heavy old base as in
data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-09.png	Fig. 2.
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-00.png	Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-01.png	does the balance of nature by killing both pests
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-02.png	and predators, is viewed with concern by a
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-03.png	number of American State Research Stations. Not
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-04.png	content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-05.png	of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture,
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-06.png	some stations are carrying out useful research on
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-07.png	pest control by biological means. Both native and
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-08.png	imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-09.png	are used in field trial tests.
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-00.png	The biological control of pests in the garden
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-01.png	is not new to the American gardener. Lady-
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-02.png	birds figure in press advertisements, their
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-03.png	sale being by the gallon. Praying mantis (Mantis
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-04.png	religiosa), both native and &quot;immigrant&quot; varieties,
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-05.png	are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-06.png	States. Advertisements offer eggs of European,
data/e07/e07-007/e07-007-07.png	Chinese or native forms of mantis.
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-00.png	From the day it hatches in the spring
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-01.png	until it dies in the late autumn, the
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-02.png	praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-03.png	eating other insects. Nine blowflies
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-04.png	may be consumed at one sitting and
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-05.png	the fully adult, 2 1/2-in.-long insect,
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-06.png	is able to keep a firm hold on one
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-07.png	grasshopper while eating another.
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-08.png	According to Dr. Max Beier in &quot;Fang-
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-09.png	heuschrecken&quot; (Die Neue Brehm Bu&quot;ckerei,
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-10.png	1952), the praying mantis is trecking
data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-11.png	northwards.
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-00.png	Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-01.png	egg-case of the Chinese mantis. The
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-02.png	first mantis had hatched from the very large
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-03.png	egg-case on June 6. Both the Chinese
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-04.png	and Spanish mantis, in the young stage
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-05.png	at any rate, are light brown in colour.
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-06.png	Because of the cool, wet weather, I had great
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-07.png	difficulty in breeding fruit flies and, after
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-08.png	many of the mantis of both types had died
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-09.png	in my Kilner jars, I poured living mantis
data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-10.png	over vines and peachtrees.
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-00.png	A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-01.png	Grantham, Lincs, kindly offered to
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-02.png	cooperate with me in studying praying
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-03.png	mantis as a pest control in the cold
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-04.png	greenhouse. Of the dozen Spanish mantis
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-05.png	sent him by post on June 22, only two or
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-06.png	three survived the journey; one thrived
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-07.png	and the latest report I have is that
data/e07/e07-066/e07-066-08.png	this mantis is still alive.
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-00.png	DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-01.png	since the end of the war, clay pots are
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-02.png	still in greatest demand. It is mostly
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-03.png	in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-04.png	have made headway, and although
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-05.png	numerous small clay pots are used each
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-06.png	year, they are fewer than they were 10
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-07.png	years ago. In the larger sizes there is still
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-08.png	no real substitute for clay that can be
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-09.png	obtained at a comparable price, except the
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-10.png	bituminized paper pots which are used on
data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-11.png	commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-00.png	The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-01.png	brittle nature; even with reasonably careful
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-02.png	handling, the annual losses are often around
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-03.png	10 per cent., and where the handling and
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-04.png	storage facilities are not too good, these
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-05.png	losses will be even greater. This does not
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-06.png	necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-07.png	they are not quite so fragile as the
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-08.png	smaller ones and are not normally thrown
data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-09.png	about in quite the same way.
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-00.png	The storage problem puts clay pots at a
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-01.png	definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-02.png	and difficult things to accommodate and
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-03.png	they must have some protection from severe
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-04.png	weather, which can be quite a headache in
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-05.png	a small garden. While admitting that
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-06.png	broken pots have on occasions provided
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-07.png	artists with delightful studies, there is no
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-08.png	doubt that a pile of badly stacked,
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-09.png	half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-10.png	from any point of view.
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-00.png	Every garden boy will agree that having to
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-01.png	wash clay pots is a definite factor in
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-02.png	favour of their abolition; in fact one
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-03.png	young man was so wholehearted about this
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-04.png	a few years ago that he made the headlines
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-05.png	for having smashed a large number # to
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-06.png	relieve his feelings. On the small-to-medium
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-07.png	establishment, it is a disagreeable chore
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-08.png	which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm,
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-09.png	whereas on larger establishments the pots
data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-10.png	can be sterilized or washed by machine.
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-00.png	It is not easy to make an economic
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-01.png	comparison between clay pots and the various
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-02.png	substitutes; the former may last indefinitely
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-03.png	with luck, while the latter are often
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-04.png	expendable used only once. Clay pots are
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-05.png	efficient and congenial containers in which
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-06.png	to grow plants. In their proper setting they
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-07.png	are not unattractive and, in spite of
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-08.png	their shortcomings, most gardeners have
data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-09.png	a nostalgic affection for them.
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-00.png	Present-day pots are better finished, do
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-01.png	not get dirty so readily and are easier to
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-02.png	wash. The deep rims make for neater and
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-03.png	safer stacking, though they are still
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-04.png	expensive and still get broken. On the
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-05.png	other hand, there is really no replacement
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-06.png	for the larger sizes, so they have the
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-07.png	decided advantage of being the only
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-08.png	suitable container available in quantity
data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-09.png	for fairly large plants.
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-00.png	Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-01.png	pots for plant raising. These are compressed blocks of
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-02.png	compost, made in a specially devised press to
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-03.png	simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot.
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-04.png	Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-05.png	are made of the same compost as would have
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-06.png	been used in a pot, the # only difference being
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-07.png	that it is used in a slightly moister
data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-08.png	condition.
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-00.png	Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-01.png	in the normal way, the only real difference
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-02.png	being that more of the watering is done through a
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-03.png	rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-04.png	of water. First-class plants of tomatoes,
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-05.png	cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers,
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-06.png	celery and onions, may all be raised in soil
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-07.png	blocks; so can such flowering plants as
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-08.png	dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas,
data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-09.png	lupins and numerous others.
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-00.png	One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-01.png	one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-02.png	completely. Manufacturing the block and planting
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-03.png	it is very little more trouble than normal potting,
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-04.png	and a superior plant, which transplants more
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-05.png	easily, is produced. The obvious limitation #
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-06.png	is that soil blocks can only be used for
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-07.png	propagating; there can be no progression to a
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-08.png	larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-09.png	to be moved; it must be planted out or
data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-10.png	potted.
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-00.png	Many amateur gardeners might improve their
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-01.png	results by buying a small hand-operated soil
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-02.png	block maker and use the money saved on
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-03.png	buying small pots to improve their composts.
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-04.png	The various types of small paper pots are very
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-05.png	useful for short-term operations, but are
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-06.png	inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-07.png	too long.
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-00.png	They are # quite useful for plants that are
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-01.png	despatched to market or direct to customers,
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-02.png	their cheapness making them attractive to the
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-03.png	nurseryman; there is also considerable saving
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-04.png	in carriage costs because of their lightness.
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-05.png	There are many types of plastic pots available;
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-06.png	some expensive, some quite cheap; some good
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-07.png	and others not so good. A wide range of
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-08.png	plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-09.png	usually need less water than those in clay
data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-10.png	pots.
data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-00.png	They are slightly more difficult to
data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-01.png	manage, however, until a little experience
data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-02.png	has been gained with them. Plastic pots
data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-03.png	are usually more expensive than clay ones,
data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-04.png	but they are almost indestructible and
data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-05.png	will last a long time with normal care.
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-00.png	And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-01.png	&quot;mind&quot; vanishes, at any rate for some time. It seems very difficult
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-02.png	to detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological,
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-03.png	surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-04.png	close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-05.png	word &quot;soul&quot; to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-06.png	essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-07.png	the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word &quot;mind&quot; for
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-08.png	the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-09.png	are clearly associated with the brain.
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-00.png	Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-01.png	picture of this &quot;basis&quot; of mental phenomena?
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-02.png	The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-03.png	with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-04.png	picture of the basis of such material phenomena
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-05.png	as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-06.png	gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-07.png	theories of &quot;mind&quot;? Are there any ultimate units
data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-08.png	of mind akin to the atoms of matter?
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-00.png	At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-01.png	be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-02.png	identified as elementary sensations. These were
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-03.png	thought to combine together to form compound
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-04.png	experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-05.png	matter combine to form molecular compounds.
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-06.png	But this view led to too many difficulties and
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-07.png	was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-08.png	for basic units of mind has gone on and will
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-09.png	doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to
data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-10.png	discover ultimate units.
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-00.png	We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-01.png	close analogy between the units of quite different
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-02.png	sciences. For example the success of the atomic theory
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-03.png	in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-04.png	units of geometry must be points. It would be more
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-05.png	correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-06.png	geometry.
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-00.png	There have been many conflicting tendencies in
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-01.png	psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-02.png	we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-03.png	concept which is current today. It is known as the schema.
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-04.png	It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-05.png	concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-06.png	but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction.
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-00.png	The numerically largest group, consisting of male
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-01.png	weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-02.png	and in the works only, excluding the offices, was
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-03.png	therefore selected. A detailed age-structure was
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-04.png	compiled from personnel department records,
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-05.png	revealing that there were (at that time) seven-
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-06.png	teen men seventy years of age or older,
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-07.png	thirty-three aged sixty-four years, and sixty-
data/f02/f02-000/f02-000-08.png	five just fifty years of age.
data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-00.png	A small panel was formed, not on a formally representative
data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-01.png	basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals,
data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-02.png	from various levels in the firm. In due course
data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-03.png	the panel decided to seek further insight into the
data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-04.png	problems faced by older workers, and approached
data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-05.png	those seventy years of age or older.
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-00.png	The Rubery, Owen scheme is now in its
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-01.png	fourth year, and opportunity has been taken
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-02.png	to revise the course in the light of
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-03.png	experience. Topics for the six weekly meetings
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-04.png	of one-and-a-half hours (each held half in
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-05.png	company time, half in the man's time) are
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-06.png	now as follows: 1. Personal adjustment 2. Health
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-07.png	3. Work and leisure 4. Living arrangements
data/f02/f02-017/f02-017-08.png	5. Financial planning 6. Final discussion
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-00.png	The latter do not regard themselves as expert
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-01.png	advisers, but are prepared to seek out the
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-02.png	appropriate sources of information or advice.
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-03.png	Towards the end of 1956, Mr. Daniel Grant,
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-04.png	an Employee Relations Officer of
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-05.png	Rolls-Royce Ltd. and a member of the
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-06.png	Workers' Educational Association, submitted
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-07.png	to the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Dr. Andrew
data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-08.png	Hood, a copy of his report on an enquiry

data/f02/f02-033/f02-033-10.png	older workers and the effects of retirement

data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-00.png	The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-01.png	fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty:
data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-02.png	the first of these is due in 1963. Meanwhile, each
data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-03.png	'graduate' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-04.png	working out his ideas, either through the company's
data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-05.png	personnel department or by an approach to
data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-06.png	members of the panel responsible for the scheme.
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-00.png	The Lord Provost, having studied the report on 'The Morale and
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-01.png	Health of Retired Workers', and being satisfied that the matters
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-02.png	raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-03.png	Glasgow and warranted further study, set an informal
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-04.png	committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-05.png	the welfare of older people to examine the report and
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-06.png	its implications and to consider the advisability of
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-07.png	arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-08.png	Occupational Activities on Retirement.
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-00.png	The large attendance and atmosphere of
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-01.png	this Conference, held in October, 1957,
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-02.png	reflected not only an increasing awareness
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-03.png	of the problems of men and women nearing
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-04.png	or already in retirement but also a strong
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-05.png	desire on the part of all concerned for
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-06.png	concerted action towards preparing men
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-07.png	and women for life in retirement and more
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-08.png	adequate provision of facilities for
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-09.png	crafts, hobbies and leisure-time interests
data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-10.png	for those who are retired.
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-00.png	As a result, the Glasgow Retirement Council came
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-01.png	into being in April, 1958, with Dr. Andrew Hood as
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-02.png	chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary. The
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-03.png	Council has active committees on Education and
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-04.png	Preparation for Retirement, and on Occupational
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-05.png	Centres. The former consists of representatives from
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-06.png	the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department;
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-07.png	the Workers' Educational Association; the University
data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-08.png	Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments

data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-00.png	So - see the next page! Yes, they are waiting for you.
data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-01.png	But there is no need to be frightened. The audience
data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-02.png	will eat out of your hand - if they like what
data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-03.png	you offer them. A good start will put them in a
data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-04.png	good humour. Ladies and gentlemen! I'm afraid
data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-05.png	I have not had much experience of public speaking.
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-00.png	But that's a terrible way to begin! Why tell them you
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-01.png	are a novice? It's their interest you want - not their
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-02.png	sympathy. And you want to get it from the word
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-03.png	GO! Try something like this: It is said that tele-
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-04.png	vision keeps people at home. But you, at any
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-05.png	rate, have proved that wrong. And they say, too,
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-06.png	that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-07.png	intelligence.
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-00.png	May I suggest that you have proved that
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-01.png	right! Congratulations! And away you go into
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-02.png	your speech. Take some thought, too, for your ending.
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-03.png	Thank you for listening to me so patiently. A political
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-04.png	candidate often used that finish. No wonder he
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-05.png	didn't get in! Instead he might have ended
data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-06.png	this way: Well, those are my views.
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-00.png	When he learned what was causing the commotion he
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-01.png	became greatly alarmed, and after the body had been
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-02.png	taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-03.png	grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-04.png	Camp, aged thirty-three, the girl who was to have
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-05.png	been his bride. There was little doubt of how
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-06.png	she had met her death, and even less that it
data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-07.png	had been murder.
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-00.png	The body was examined, and it was definitely
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-01.png	established that no sexual assault had taken place.
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-02.png	It seemed probable that the motive had been
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-03.png	robbery, and this was further confirmed when a
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-04.png	check was made with the woman's relations in
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-05.png	Hounslow. Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-06.png	Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. Her day
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-07.png	off was Thursday, and before coming up to London
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-08.png	in the evening she had called on her two sisters,
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-09.png	one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-10.png	other at Hounslow, where she kept a shop.
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-00.png	Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon,
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-01.png	and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M., where
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-02.png	she had tea with her other sister, and then
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-03.png	went to catch the 7.42. Her sister saw her
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-04.png	to the station, helping her with some of
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-05.png	her packages. This sister was able to establish
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-06.png	that she had carried a green purse and
data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-07.png	had bought a railway ticket.
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-00.png	She had been struck several times with a blunt
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-01.png	instrument, and her head was smashed in.
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-02.png	There were signs of a violent struggle, blood
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-03.png	on the cushions and floor, and the remains
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-04.png	of her broken umbrella. But a pair of bone
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-05.png	cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-06.png	to provide the only possible clue to the killer.
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-00.png	The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-01.png	when the distance to the church deterred many from
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-02.png	coming to Sunday Evensong. We managed to furnish
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-03.png	a table with cross and candles, and the people
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-04.png	appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-05.png	as for more secular purposes. In 1910 Dr. Talbot
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-06.png	was translated to Winchester, and Dr. Hubert
data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-07.png	Burge became Bishop of Southwark.
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-00.png	Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-01.png	work in connection with Higher Religious Education, and
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-02.png	to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-03.png	Union. This meant organizing lectures and courses of
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-04.png	religious instruction through the Diocese, and I
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-05.png	also found myself a member of the Diocesan
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-06.png	Conference, where I remember introducing myself as
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-07.png	the incumbent of the highest church in the
data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-08.png	Diocese.
data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-00.png	There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-01.png	some quarters, until I explained that my church
data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-02.png	was 800 feet high above the sea level! The
data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-03.png	work was growing pretty heavy, and we managed
data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-04.png	to get a stipendiary layman who could help
data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-05.png	among the children and young people.
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-00.png	Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-01.png	me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-02.png	lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-03.png	continuing till old age to-day. When I went
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-04.png	to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-05.png	with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-06.png	and his family, the youngest of whose three
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-07.png	sons was just coming into the world in this year
data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-08.png	of 1913.
data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-00.png	But both purse and ticket, and the packages, were gone when the body
data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-01.png	was found at Waterloo. Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-02.png	likely that she had been carrying much money. A porter at Hounslow
data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-03.png	supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-04.png	compartment when the train left, but this did not help much, since it
data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-05.png	had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo.
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-00.png	It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-01.png	in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play. The place and its people were
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-02.png	to play an important part in my life. For five years in succession till
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-03.png	war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays there and became
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-04.png	very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between the
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-05.png	Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-06.png	performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would
data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-07.png	be discovered and trained.
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-00.png	First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-01.png	any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-02.png	old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-03.png	and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-04.png	teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-05.png	the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-06.png	could render simple part-singing tolerably well.
data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-00.png	Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's 'Hiawatha's
data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-01.png	Wedding Feast.' Enthusiasm grew, and in a few more months we
data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-02.png	gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster,
data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-03.png	and the tenor solo 'Onaway awake' was sung by the Rector.
data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-04.png	Friends from Limpsfield, in addition to the villagers, came up,
data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-05.png	and we were all happy.
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-00.png	For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-01.png	in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-02.png	four or more children, compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-03.png	and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957. As with the price of energy index,
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-04.png	the only noteworthy change was for households with three children,
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-05.png	in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-06.png	all households in the sample.
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-00.png	This man agreed that his engagement had
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-01.png	been broken off after one particular
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-02.png	tiff, but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-03.png	money. All the while the police were casting about
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-04.png	for a man who had been seen leaving the train
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-05.png	at Wandsworth. A passenger described this individual
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-06.png	as a man of about thirty, of medium height, with
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-07.png	a dark moustache, and wearing a frockcoat
data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-08.png	and a top-hat.
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-00.png	The porter at the station bore out this
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-01.png	description, but the man was not traced.
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-02.png	Perhaps the news of their search got around,
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-03.png	for a man did obligingly present himself
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-04.png	at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-05.png	committed the murder - but he was mentally
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-06.png	defective, and, despite his claim to infamy,
data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-07.png	had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-00.png	And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-01.png	adjournments, until April 7, finally had to be content to return
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-02.png	a verdict of &quot;wilful murder against some person or
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-03.png	persons unknown.&quot; The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-04.png	pestle had been of no assistance. The killer must
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-05.png	have been very thankful that the science of
data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-06.png	dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings.
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-00.png	The next female fatality occurred eight years later,
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-01.png	yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-02.png	a further seven years before even a ghost of a
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-03.png	solution emerged. There has always been something
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-04.png	sinister in the idea of tunnels. The building of
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-05.png	them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-06.png	nected with railway construction; and there
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-07.png	were many people who believed that to travel
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-08.png	through tunnels would be an equally
data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-09.png	hazardous business.
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-00.png	Some thought that the result would be all
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-01.png	sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-02.png	confined atmosphere. &quot;The shareholders who travel
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-03.png	by it will be so heartily sick, what with the
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-04.png	foul air, smoke and sulphur, that the mention
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-05.png	of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha,&quot;
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-06.png	wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-07.png	proposed to build the Box Tunnel.
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-00.png	The mere thought of subterranean travel
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-01.png	gave others a feeling of danger. A medical journal
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-02.png	said, &quot;the deafening peal of thunder, the sudden
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-03.png	immersion in gloom, and the clash of reverberated
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-04.png	sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-05.png	momentary shudder, or idea of destruction, a thrill
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-06.png	of annihilation.&quot; It was also prophesied that
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-07.png	passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-08.png	darkness.
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-00.png	For all that, as far as England is concerned,
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-01.png	there have been only two occasions on
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-02.png	which a body has been found in a tunnel
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-03.png	in circumstances pointing to murder.
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-04.png	The first was that of Mr Gold, in the famous
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-05.png	Lefroy case, and by an odd chance the second tragedy
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-06.png	occurred on the same line, although this time the
data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-07.png	victim was a woman.
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-00.png	Though in the minds of most people there was
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-01.png	no doubt that the woman had been the victim
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-02.png	of foul play, the verdict brought in was that there
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-03.png	was not sufficient evidence to show whether
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-04.png	she had fallen or been thrown from a train.
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-05.png	The Merstham Tunnel, on the London-to-
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-06.png	Brighton line, is approximately one mile long,
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-07.png	and some time before midnight on September
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-08.png	24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of
data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-09.png	the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway,
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-00.png	So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-01.png	long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-02.png	remained a mystery until later the following day.
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-03.png	During that time a description of the girl was
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-04.png	circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-05.png	identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two.
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-06.png	The girl, who was described as being &quot;always bright and
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-07.png	jolly,&quot; had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill,
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-08.png	Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-09.png	whom she worked as a book-keeper.
data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-00.png	On the Sunday, the day of her death, she had gone out in the
data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-01.png	evening at about seven o'clock, telling her room-mate, Emma
data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-02.png	Hone, that she was going for a walk, but would not be
data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-03.png	gone for long. According to Miss Hone, she had not been
data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-04.png	carrying a handbag, but she believed she had had a small
data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-05.png	purse.
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-00.png	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-01.png	told us that there was nothing an En-
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-02.png	glishman would not do; nothing an Ame-
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-03.png	rican would not say; nothing an
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-04.png	Italian would not sing; no music
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-05.png	to which the Frenchman would not
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-06.png	dance; nothing the German would
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-07.png	not covet; and nothing the Chinese
data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-08.png	would not eat.
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-00.png	According to Pliny, and others, certain herbs
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-01.png	and flowers proved of sovereign power
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-02.png	clarifying the functions of the brain. It
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-03.png	is said that there is nothing new under
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-04.png	the sun, but regarding foodstuffs the
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-05.png	traveller occasionally encounters a certain
data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-06.png	measure of novelty.
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-00.png	In China, for instance, dried rats are esteemed
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-01.png	a delicacy. The visitor is told that
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-02.png	they restore the hair of the bald and that
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-03.png	a stewed black rat will ward off a fever.
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-04.png	A number of newly-born white mice served
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-05.png	alive, dipped in treacle and swallowed
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-06.png	like a prairie oyster is considered a
data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-07.png	piece of resistance.
data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-00.png	Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards

data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-04.png	as an article of diet. So have the Japanese
data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-05.png	and the Chinese. The Celestials, apart
data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-06.png	from eating it fresh, squash it, press
data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-07.png	it and dry it, in which form, dusted
data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-08.png	over with flour, you will find a stack
data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-09.png	of it in almost any provision shop.
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-00.png	Their friendship for Augusta became rather
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-01.png	hollow, and the news that Byron had left
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-02.png	her practically all his money caused it to
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-03.png	crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-04.png	knew perfectly well that Byron, as early
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-05.png	as the year of their wedding, 1815, had
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-06.png	made a will in Augusta's favour, she had
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-07.png	evidently not passed on that information;
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-08.png	and it came as an appalling surprise to
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-09.png	Captain Byron that he had been left
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-10.png	without the fortune that would keep up the
data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-11.png	title.
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-00.png	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-01.png	told us that there was nothing an Englishman
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-02.png	would not do; nothing an American would not
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-03.png	say; nothing an Italian would not sing; no
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-04.png	music to which the Frenchman would not dance;
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-05.png	nothing the German would not covet; and
data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-06.png	nothing the Chinese would not eat.
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-00.png	It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum.
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-01.png	Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-02.png	the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-03.png	borrowed straight from the prehistoric. How
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-04.png	many centuries ago, in some cave or hilly
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-05.png	hide, did our forebears home from the chase
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-06.png	hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-07.png	meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-08.png	homely and protecting flame.
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-00.png	How many centuries later did the mercenary in
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-01.png	the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-02.png	evening meal. Later came the thrifty peasant,
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-03.png	later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-04.png	in Paris, and even later our attractive young
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-05.png	ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-06.png	gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants.
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-00.png	And, if certain dishes and modes of food have
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-01.png	persisted down the ages, the motive that preserved
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-02.png	them has always been the same. Apart from the need
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-03.png	for nourishment, the instinct of hospitality has
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-04.png	always been strong in mankind. The sharing of
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-05.png	a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-06.png	admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-07.png	important than the casual meetings of the present
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-08.png	day; the desire to share something more intimate
data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-09.png	than mere converse has always been there.
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-00.png	Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-01.png	procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-02.png	of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-03.png	grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-04.png	the dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-05.png	eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-06.png	intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-07.png	nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-08.png	monstrous.
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-00.png	Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-01.png	water and food? The ancient Britons, I believe, used to
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-02.png	make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-03.png	because their pots would not stand fire; but Jacob
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-04.png	must have had one that would, because Esau sold
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-05.png	his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-06.png	then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-07.png	which the Israelites sighed.
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-00.png	Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have known any
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-01.png	way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling.
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-02.png	When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-03.png	was a grill, which he cooked himself, and he knew
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-04.png	how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-05.png	length subside, He throws a bed of glowing
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-06.png	embers wide; Above the coals the smoking
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-07.png	fragment turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from
data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-08.png	lifted urns
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-00.png	When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-01.png	fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-02.png	made rapid progress, because they were men of taste
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-03.png	and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-04.png	of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-05.png	confine the resources of the table to the gratification
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-06.png	of one sense alone. Having exhausted their invention
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-07.png	in the preparation of stimulants for the palate,
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-08.png	they broke fresh ground and called another sense
data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-09.png	to their aid.
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-00.png	By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-01.png	perfumes, these refined voluptuaries aroused the
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-02.png	fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-03.png	ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-04.png	board. The gratification of the sense of smelling
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-05.png	was a subject of no little importance to the Romans.
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-06.png	They considered flowers as forming a very essential
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-07.png	article in their festal preparations; and it is the
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-08.png	opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-09.png	number of flowers far exceeded the number
data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-10.png	of fruits.
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-00.png	Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-01.png	roasted on the point of a spear are definitely
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-02.png	a delicacy while Mediterranean peoples have a
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-03.png	high opinion of the octopus as an article of diet.
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-04.png	So have the Japanese and the Chinese. The
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-05.png	Celestials, apart from eating it fresh, squash
data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-06.png	it, press it and dry it, in which form, dusted

data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-08.png	in almost any provision shop.
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-00.png	Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-01.png	than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-02.png	activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed.
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-03.png	We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-04.png	one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-05.png	which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years.
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-06.png	If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-07.png	with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation,
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-08.png	Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-09.png	provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-00.png	The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-01.png	Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-02.png	aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-03.png	fire, aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-04.png	crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-05.png	celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-06.png	cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-07.png	and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured, sometimes
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-08.png	Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with
data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-09.png	streaks of poetry, meat disguised under heavy and vehement
data/f07/f07-081b/f07-081b-00.png	The French have an inborn appreciation of good food and
data/f07/f07-081b/f07-081b-01.png	the gusto which they derive from gastronomy is intellectual

data/f07/f07-081b/f07-081b-03.png	about their feeding, the same subtle delicacy of touch,
data/f07/f07-081b/f07-081b-04.png	the same unfailing sense of proportion as exists among

data/f07/f07-081b/f07-081b-06.png	things that are typically French.
data/f07/f07-084b/f07-084b-00.png	The "pot-au-feu" is as much a national institution
data/f07/f07-084b/f07-084b-01.png	in France as is tea drinking among ourselves and it is
data/f07/f07-084b/f07-084b-02.png	prepared at least once a week in every bourgeois
data/f07/f07-084b/f07-084b-03.png	household. Thackeray, of course, waxed enthusiastic

data/f07/f07-084b/f07-084b-05.png	noble dish is, A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,

data/f07/f07-076a/f07-076a-00.png	The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is
data/f07/f07-076a/f07-076a-01.png	so languorous, so passionate, and
data/f07/f07-076a/f07-076a-02.png	possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
data/f07/f07-076a/f07-076a-03.png	melody. The paprika and caraway perfume

data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-00.png	Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food. At one
data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-01.png	dinner he is said to have been blind to the charms of
data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-02.png	turbot and to have been much more interested in the
data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-03.png	dish in which it was served. He turned # it over
data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-04.png	on the table cloth to examine the marks on the back
data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-05.png	without going through the formality of having his turbot
data/f07/f07-092b/f07-092b-06.png	removed first.
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-00.png	Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast,
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-01.png	placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-02.png	he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-03.png	which he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-04.png	with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a brown
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-05.png	sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
data/f07/f07-096/f07-096-06.png	gin punch.
data/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-00.png	The same man went to see Carlyle, and, after mentioning
data/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-01.png	that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a
data/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-02.png	very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh;
data/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-03.png	but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to
data/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-04.png	ask if his guest would have a cup of tea!
data/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-00.png	When he saw Trelawny's printed letter, Lord Sidney wrote
data/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-01.png	to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
data/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-02.png	throughout. He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
data/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-03.png	and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
data/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-04.png	body to return to England than that course was
data/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-05.png	'immediately carried into effect' - not in spite of himself

data/f07/f07-101a/f07-101a-00.png	THE SAME MAN WENT TO SEE CARLYLE, AND,

data/g07/g07-007a/g07-007a-06.png	TO HAVE FOUND EVERYTHING IN UTTERMOST
data/g07/g07-007a/g07-007a-07.png	DISORDER - 'TOKENS THAT THE PILGRIM

data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-00.png	It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-01.png	Londoners, but it brought heavy censure from nobles
data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-02.png	who still believed that they had a monopoly of
data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-03.png	leadership. But, at last, Gaunt sailed. Opposing
data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-04.png	him was the French Admiral, Jean de Vienne -
data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-05.png	a great sailor and an able strategist.
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-00.png	Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-01.png	trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-02.png	on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-03.png	an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-04.png	something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-05.png	the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-06.png	involved the dreary method of mining operations in
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-07.png	which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown
data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-08.png	considerable skill at the siege of Limoges.
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-00.png	When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-01.png	moment had charge of the mine; the mine collapsed
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-02.png	fame and glory. Gaunt was compelled to return
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-03.png	even despised failure. The 'ribald' Londoners, who
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-04.png	Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-05.png	comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-06.png	citizen.
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-00.png	These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-01.png	obvious morals for those who are judges long
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-02.png	after the event. It seems obvious that, though
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-03.png	the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-04.png	plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-05.png	battle was no substitute for a sound policy,
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-06.png	and that, if archers had no target, campaigns
data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-07.png	became mere marauding route marches.
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-00.png	It seems obvious that if an expedition to
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-01.png	Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais,
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-02.png	then the primary essential to the success
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-03.png	of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-04.png	command of the Channel. It seems obvious
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-05.png	that divided forces were dissipating the
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-06.png	advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-07.png	Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bordeaux and Bayonne,
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-08.png	and that there was no hope of final victory
data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-09.png	without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.
data/g01/g01-022/g01-022-00.png	BUT NONE OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE
data/g01/g01-022/g01-022-01.png	DRAWN AT THE TIME, BECAUSE LARGE-
data/g01/g01-022/g01-022-02.png	SCALE WAR REQUIRED MONEY, AND
data/g01/g01-022/g01-022-03.png	THE CITIZENS WHO HAD THE MONEY

data/g01/g01-022/g01-022-08.png	DESPISED THEM. THE COMMONS WERE
data/g01/g01-022/g01-022-09.png	GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-00.png	In this cruel process which was
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-01.png	hammering out nations on the anvils of
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-02.png	war, there was a constant stirring of
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-03.png	those in authority to find some simple
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-04.png	way out of the complicated financial
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-05.png	6impasse which always resulted, and in the
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-06.png	story of the experiments and expedients
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-07.png	to which the Exchequer resorted is
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-08.png	the story of the prelude to the
data/g01/g01-025/g01-025-09.png	Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-00.png	In appreciating this story, modern con-
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-01.png	ceptions of governmental duties must be
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-02.png	set aside. A modern government needs
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-03.png	taxation not merely for defence and
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-04.png	offence but for a very wide range of
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-05.png	social services. A mediaeval oligarchy
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-06.png	needed taxation in order to supplement
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-07.png	the private wealth of the monarchy
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-08.png	(the royal income from the revenues of
data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-09.png	crown lands, the fees of feudalism
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-00.png	Social service as a function of government
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-01.png	was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-02.png	substitute was the mutual self-help of
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-03.png	communities, whether those communities were
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-04.png	monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-05.png	guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-06.png	therefore in essence a forced payment whose
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-07.png	return was the uncertain bounty of booty
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-08.png	and the vague advantages of military glory;
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-09.png	it was therefore always granted grudgingly
data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-10.png	and coupled with the vain hope that, in the
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-00.png	When 'his' war did not bring victory and
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-01.png	booty, a new group of Lords might oust
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-02.png	the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons,
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-03.png	who usually supplied the hard cash, might
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-04.png	be bold enough to demand the production of
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-05.png	accounts, and even at times the impeachment of
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-06.png	the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-07.png	the people, and even a full Parliament was
data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-08.png	not yet a true mirror of the nation.
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-00.png	The people - Langland's 'folk' and Gaunt's
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-01.png	'knaves' - were villeins still tied to the
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-02.png	feudal obligations of work or villeins who
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-03.png	had bought their release, free labourers
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-04.png	who worked for the highest bidders, free
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-05.png	yeomen who had prospered enough to become
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-06.png	successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen,
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-07.png	journeymen and small tradesmen of the
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-08.png	towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms
data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-09.png	in the pay of landed Lords.
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-00.png	None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-01.png	expected to pay direct taxes. During the four-
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-02.png	teenth century, the traditional methods of
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-03.png	financing the Exchequer had become stabilized.
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-04.png	When the King and his Council required additio-
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-05.png	nal funds, they were usually granted an
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-06.png	export tax on the wool trade, collected by
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-07.png	means of that 'staple' system which ensured that
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-08.png	prices, quality and tax could be efficiently su-
data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-09.png	pervised and controlled, together with a
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-00.png	There were two other sources of public revenue -
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-01.png	first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-02.png	of the Commons and in its own Convocations
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-03.png	granted equivalent contributions, and second,
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-04.png	the foreign merchants, with whom the King's
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-05.png	officials had formerly made private bargains
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-06.png	at 'colloquies of merchants', and whose
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-07.png	payments were now authorized by parliamentary
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-08.png	sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-09.png	excess of the rate for native merchants.
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-00.png	In addition to these revenues, the King had the
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-01.png	financial benefits of his position at the head
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-02.png	of the feudal system, as its chief landowner
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-03.png	and the recipient of the fines of royal justice.
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-04.png	It was, therefore, a complicated and not very
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-05.png	satisfactory financial system in which the
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-06.png	borders between private and public purse were
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-07.png	as ill-defined as the borders between private
data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-08.png	and national war, and in which the comparati-

data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-00.png	A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-01.png	to mediaeval eyes. It was determined that 100,000
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-02.png	was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-03.png	two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-04.png	the remainder. The method of assessment to which the
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-05.png	Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-06.png	injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-07.png	corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax,
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-08.png	but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-09.png	weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-10.png	had to pay three groats, but this time an adult was re-

data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-04.png	the date of birth of each child, as had been done

data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-03.png	or in flagging warmer ones. At the time of its movement
data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-04.png	the heart becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken,
data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-05.png	its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-06.png	content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals
data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-07.png	such as serpents, frogs, and the like.

data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-01.png	of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and

data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-03.png	contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three

data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-06.png	contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in

data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-03.png	He was a socialist and believed in the right
data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-04.png	of the working class to control their own destiny, and
data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-05.png	said so. Being a craftsman and a skilled man,
data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-06.png	George won many prizes, and though some people
data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-07.png	would have nothing to do with him, others
data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-08.png	would, and the comrades helped in many

data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-00.png	Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings.
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-01.png	One of the helpful by-products was that
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-02.png	they were able to obtain some respectable
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-03.png	clothing, with which they wore a white tie
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-04.png	and Red Flag badge, thus presenting a much
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-05.png	better appearance. Later, on many a sunny Sunday
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-06.png	evening, when George went to speak at Malin Bridge,
data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-07.png	they would be there to begin the meeting.

data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-04.png	He christened the babies. Also, when
data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-05.png	called upon to do so, he would officiate

data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-08.png	with the Bible, which he had
data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-09.png	read in prison where it was the
data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-10.png	only book they were allowed,

data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-01.png	to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-02.png	with them, particularly those who, like the Rev.
data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-03.png	Conrad Noel, the eloquent leader of
data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-04.png	the Church Socialist League, genuinely advocated
data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-05.png	socialism. With such men, who had the
data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-06.png	courage of their convictions and their
data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-07.png	Christianity, common ground could be found.

data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-04.png	gain her attention. &quot;The truth is that
data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-05.png	if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-06.png	time originally arranged, Sir John would
data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-07.png	have had it in for Guy.
data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-00.png	You see, it was, apparently, through a mistake
data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-01.png	on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-02.png	flamingoes our first morning on the island.&quot;
data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-03.png	&quot;What harm could possibly have come to Forrest

data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-05.png	hardly have spoken with more contempt.
data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-06.png	A bully like that respects anyone who

data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-00.png	Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-01.png	precisely the remark she had made to Guy.
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-02.png	She said icily, "As you pride yourself on
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-03.png	your knowledge of all the affairs of the
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-04.png	island I needn't tell you that Sir John
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-05.png	Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-06.png	important customers." "So what? You're not
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-07.png	trying to say that Hewson would victimise
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-08.png	Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-09.png	courage!
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-00.png	He's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-01.png	himself and his business to an unmention-
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-02.png	able destination.&quot; &quot;There's a difference
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-03.png	between what a senior and a junior
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-04.png	partner can do,&quot; was her quick reply.
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-05.png	&quot;What they can bring off! I'll admit that.
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-06.png	But Forrest might at least have tried. He's
data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-07.png	pretty spineless!&quot;
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-00.png	&quot;You think you could have carried more weight
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-01.png	with Sir John?&quot; she enquired cuttingly.
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-02.png	&quot;For all your good opinion of yourself,
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-03.png	I doubt it. He's about as easy to push around
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-04.png	as - as a grounded whale!&quot; He had to smile
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-05.png	at that, but went on airily, &quot;I'd have made
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-06.png	an attempt to show my lady-love that I
data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-07.png	put her interests before my own.
data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-00.png	His voice was like his black and pin-stripe,
data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-01.png	a grey superimposition of respectability over
data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-02.png	the original colour of his own natural vowels,
data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-03.png	the result being somehow as ineffective, not

data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-05.png	His digressions too, seemed to have no other
data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-06.png	purpose than the throwing of dust in his
data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-07.png	client's eyes, the dust of fake security, of

data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-02.png	in the Labour movement, or of only providing
data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-03.png	propaganda in order to increase the volume of
data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-04.png	socialist thought in the city, but sought to create
data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-05.png	in the Labour movement a more militant attitude
data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-06.png	capable of achieving socialism for the working
data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-07.png	people.

data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-02.png	and a gold purse in recognition of his
data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-03.png	work for the movement, was later

data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-07.png	he was a keen member of the B.S.P..
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-00.png	IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-01.png	Vicar of St. Mark's, Woodcote, Purley, a new church built
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-02.png	by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne,
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-03.png	who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-04.png	later on joint executor of his estate with his
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-05.png	solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-06.png	ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held
data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-07.png	great family consultations.
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-00.png	My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-01.png	his family, and found a very suitable house nearby
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-02.png	where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-03.png	at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-04.png	at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's.
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-05.png	This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich,
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-06.png	Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was
data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-07.png	a close friend of ours.
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-00.png	But what a change from the dear little old church
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-01.png	at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-02.png	at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-03.png	church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-04.png	had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-05.png	chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is.
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-06.png	When we had found a group of people who gladly
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-07.png	co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place
data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-08.png	of daily prayer.
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-00.png	I suggested to the congregation that it needed
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-01.png	warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-02.png	found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-03.png	stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-04.png	helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-05.png	for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-06.png	gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West
data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-07.png	windows.
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-00.png	It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-01.png	such a beautiful building with suitable fittings; I made
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-02.png	a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-03.png	the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-04.png	to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-05.png	and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-06.png	table to the environs.
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-00.png	We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-01.png	the Brighton Road, in a street full of small houses.
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-02.png	This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-03.png	there, but was soon changed into the better-
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-04.png	sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-05.png	were lots of children there, and we had
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-06.png	a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-07.png	service. I soon saw that the parish needed
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-08.png	more help both at the church and Mission
data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-09.png	district.
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-00.png	Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-01.png	were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen. Life was
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-02.png	in those years more than busy. We now had a vicarage next
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-03.png	to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-04.png	years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-05.png	well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-06.png	church.
data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-00.png	On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-01.png	Purley she offered to come and look after me. She was
data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-02.png	a real treasure, of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-03.png	things, a widow who knew how to look after the 'boy,'
data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-04.png	who was the only other occupant of the house when
data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-05.png	Mr. Evitt had gone.
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-00.png	We gathered together a splendid Sunday
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-01.png	afternoon service at the church, each child
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-02.png	being given a number which, as they came into
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-03.png	church, they could just whisper to
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-04.png	the superintendent who filled in the regi-
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-05.png	ster at her own home. Each child had a
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-06.png	picture given them and the lesson was
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-07.png	largely based on this. It was on a
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-08.png	stamp which could be stuck in
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-09.png	their book, and there was quite a
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-10.png	clamour for back stamps if a child
data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-11.png	had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-00.png	It was quite amusing to see how much
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-01.png	the children enjoyed the service, and I heard
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-02.png	of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-03.png	naughty child with the penalty of not being
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-04.png	allowed to come to the Children's Church
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-05.png	on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-06.png	kept them good in the week, but anyway
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-07.png	they were a most delightful lot, and
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-08.png	it is a great joy to meet them now
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-09.png	fifty years afterwards when so many
data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-10.png	are parents or even grandparents
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-00.png	From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-01.png	deep friendship which I have taken with me through
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-02.png	all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry. Mr. and
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-03.png	Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-04.png	years of war, when most lives were upset and
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-05.png	some tempers were easily frayed, the most
data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-06.png	loyal and devoted friends.
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-00.png	Their homes - for since those years they have
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-01.png	lived on in Purley - have always been
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-02.png	havens of rest, and the welcome has never
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-03.png	failed. Their three boys, now successful men,
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-04.png	were in our Children's Church from the
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-05.png	outset, and when we don't see one
data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-06.png	another we do not forget.
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-00.png	In those early years 1914-18, life was very full
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-01.png	both in the parish and in the wider war activities.
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-02.png	The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-03.png	Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-04.png	at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-05.png	I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-06.png	frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-07.png	the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-08.png	someone who knew their native villages.
data/g04/g04-108/g04-108-00.png	I could at once notice the great antagonism
data/g04/g04-108/g04-108-01.png	between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
data/g04/g04-108/g04-108-02.png	scorned these more simple country folk.
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-00.png	Compared with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-01.png	showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-02.png	children and those with one child, and much smaller
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-03.png	changes for couples with several children. The quantity
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-04.png	index, which has risen only slowly since 1956, was
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-05.png	almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-06.png	children, but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-07.png	households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-08.png	couples and couples with one child.
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-00.png	As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-01.png	more per calorie than the national average, and families
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-02.png	with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-03.png	substantial change was in families with three children,
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-04.png	for whom the index declined from 91 to 88. Table 27
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-05.png	also shows the corresponding values of an index which
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-06.png	compares the prices paid by different types of household
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-07.png	for the commodities constituting the average household
data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-08.png	diet in 1959.
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-00.png	Less than no response from the Russian side led
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-01.png	one to fear that the event might well have the
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-02.png	outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-03.png	lead to disaster. Then there had been much talk of
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-04.png	the setting up among the German population of a
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-05.png	general system of &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;, to be named
data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-06.png	&quot;Werewolves&quot;.
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-01.png	Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-02.png	much as his health permitted him to enjoy any-
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-03.png	thing. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-04.png	is a great resource. Vesuvius seems to be tired;
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-05.png	# he is going out fast.... What a gay, lively
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-06.png	people, and what a busy town. At Rome, every
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-07.png	other man was a priest: here the priest is
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-08.png	1superceded by the soldier - a favourable change
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-09.png	in my eye, particularly as the troops are very
data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-10.png	fine.'
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-01.png	back to England, and returned to Rome for the
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-02.png	winter. In late November, he was 'suffering as
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-03.png	usual', but hoped, he told Arthur, 'to find
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-04.png	this place agree with me better than Naples.
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-05.png	The journey has been against me, as there has
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-06.png	been much rain and damp, but the temperature
data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-07.png	is high &amp; I have not yet thought of a fire....
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-00.png	A pleasant life truly!... It so happens that I
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-01.png	have an Italian who is perhaps the best Valet
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-02.png	de Chambre that ever was. But he has not
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-03.png	one word of English.' While he was writing
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-04.png	this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs, and the
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-05.png	temporary assumption of the government by
data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-06.png	the Duke of Wellington.
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-00.png	'What a frightful event!' he wrote. 'I tremble!
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-01.png	What infatuation! Personally I am indifferent, but
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-02.png	I really tremble for my country! I may be
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-03.png	mistaken, 1tho' I cannot but fear that the
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-04.png	exasperation of the People will be so great at the
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-05.png	return of Ultratoryism, that the Commons House
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-06.png	upon a dissolution, which must be had, will be
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-07.png	a mass of Radicalism, &amp; then God knows
data/g06/g06-031a/g06-031a-08.png	what may happen....
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-00.png	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today,
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-01.png	in the 1960s, no cure has been found for
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-02.png	the 6tic douloureux. As early as 1830, when
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-03.png	Anglesey believed himself to be on the point
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-04.png	of death, the new German curative method
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-05.png	known as homoeopathy had been brought to
data/g06/g06-042a/g06-042a-06.png	his notice.
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law,
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-01.png	the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-02.png	advise Anglesey to give the system a trial, adding
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-03.png	that it was being cultivated with extraordinary
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-04.png	success in France and Italy, and that he
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-05.png	himself was being treated under a doctor who
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-06.png	had studied under its founder, the aged
data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-07.png	Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-01.png	Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-02.png	as 'more like a God upon earth than a human
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-03.png	being', had an increasing number of disciples
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-04.png	among unorthodox medical men in the cities
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-05.png	of Europe. One of these was the Neapolitan,
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-06.png	Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey consulted
data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-07.png	in # May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-01.png	master at Ko"then, near Leipzig, asking for advice.
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-02.png	In doing so he described his distinguished patient
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-03.png	and his symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-04.png	found Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-05.png	gentle and charming character, even-tempered
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-06.png	and sedate, not easily irritated, patient and
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-07.png	persevering, 'but he appears to despair of ever
data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-08.png	# being cured.'
data/g06/g06-011b/g06-011b-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted
data/g06/g06-011b/g06-011b-01.png	in Naples. He told Cloncurry that he
data/g06/g06-011b/g06-011b-02.png	enjoyed it as much as his health

data/g06/g06-047b/g06-047b-06.png	was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro,
data/g06/g06-047b/g06-047b-07.png	whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered

data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-01.png	Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-02.png	much as his health permitted him to enjoy anything.

data/g06/g06-045h/g06-045h-04.png	success in France and Italy, and that he
data/g06/g06-045h/g06-045h-05.png	himself was being treated under a doctor who
data/g06/g06-045h/g06-045h-06.png	had studied under its founder, the aged

data/g06/g06-047h/g06-047h-05.png	One of these was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro,
data/g06/g06-047h/g06-047h-06.png	whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050h/g06-050h-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master
data/g06/g06-050h/g06-050h-01.png	at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for advice. In doing
data/g06/g06-050h/g06-050h-02.png	so he described his distinguished patient and his
data/g06/g06-050h/g06-050h-03.png	symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey
data/g06/g06-050h/g06-050h-04.png	a strong, energetic man with a gentle and charming
data/g06/g06-050h/g06-050h-05.png	character, even-tempered and sedate, not easily

data/g06/g06-011j/g06-011j-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in
data/g06/g06-011j/g06-011j-01.png	Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed
data/g06/g06-011j/g06-011j-02.png	it as much as his health permitted him to
data/g06/g06-011j/g06-011j-03.png	enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived,

data/g06/g06-047l/g06-047l-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
data/g06/g06-047l/g06-047l-01.png	Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as

data/g06/g06-047l/g06-047l-05.png	One of these was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro,
data/g06/g06-047l/g06-047l-06.png	whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-01.png	master at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for advice.
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-02.png	In doing so he described his distinguished patient and
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-03.png	his symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-04.png	Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a gentle and
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-05.png	charming character, even-tempered and sedate,
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-06.png	not easily irritated, patient and persevering,
data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-07.png	'but he appears to despair of ever being cured.'
data/g06/g06-011n/g06-011n-00.png	By the end of the month he still
data/g06/g06-011n/g06-011n-01.png	delighted in Naples. He told Cloncurry
data/g06/g06-011n/g06-011n-02.png	that he enjoyed it as much as his
data/g06/g06-011n/g06-011n-03.png	health permitted him to enjoy
data/g06/g06-011n/g06-011n-04.png	anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is

data/g06/g06-018n/g06-018n-03.png	winter. In late November, he
data/g06/g06-018n/g06-018n-04.png	was 'suffering as usual', but
data/g06/g06-018n/g06-018n-05.png	hoped, he told Arthur, 'to find

data/g06/g06-037n/g06-037n-04.png	While he was in Naples there had

data/g06/g06-037n/g06-037n-07.png	an effective alleviation of his painful

data/g06/g06-042n/g06-042n-00.png	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even
data/g06/g06-042n/g06-042n-01.png	today, in the 1960s, no cure has been
data/g06/g06-042n/g06-042n-02.png	found for the 6tic douloureux. As early
data/g06/g06-042n/g06-042n-03.png	as 1830, when Anglesey believed himself
data/g06/g06-042n/g06-042n-04.png	to be on the point of death, the new

data/g06/g06-045n/g06-045n-04.png	that it was being cultivated with

data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-03.png	While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter
data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-04.png	in the history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an
data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-05.png	effective alleviation of his painful malady. None of
data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-06.png	the numerous conventional remedies to which he had
data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-07.png	been subjected ever since the symptoms had first
data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-08.png	shown themselves seventeen years before had had
data/g06/g06-037r/g06-037r-09.png	the slightest effect.
data/g06/g06-042r/g06-042r-00.png	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today, in
data/g06/g06-042r/g06-042r-01.png	the 1960s, no cure has been found for the 6tic
data/g06/g06-042r/g06-042r-02.png	douloureux. As early as 1830, when Anglesey believed
data/g06/g06-042r/g06-042r-03.png	himself to be on the point of death, the new
data/g06/g06-042r/g06-042r-04.png	German curative method known as homoeopathy
data/g06/g06-042r/g06-042r-05.png	had been brought to his notice.
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law,
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-01.png	the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to advise
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-02.png	Anglesey to give the system a trial, adding that it was
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-03.png	being cultivated with extraordinary success in France
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-04.png	and Italy, and that he himself was being treated under
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-05.png	a doctor who had studied under its founder, the aged
data/g06/g06-045r/g06-045r-06.png	Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-01.png	Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-02.png	'more like a God upon earth than a human being',
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-03.png	had an increasing number of disciples among
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-04.png	unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe. One
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-05.png	of these was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro,
data/g06/g06-047r/g06-047r-06.png	whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-01.png	at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for advice. In doing
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-02.png	so he described his distinguished patient and his
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-03.png	symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-04.png	a strong, energetic man with a gentle and charming
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-05.png	character, even-tempered and sedate, not easily
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-06.png	irritated, patient and persevering, 'but he appears to
data/g06/g06-050r/g06-050r-07.png	despair of ever being cured.'
data/g06/g06-018d/g06-018d-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl
data/g06/g06-018d/g06-018d-01.png	back to England, and returned to Rome for
data/g06/g06-018d/g06-018d-02.png	the winter. In late November, he was 'suffering as
data/g06/g06-018d/g06-018d-03.png	usual', but hoped, he told Arthur, 'to find this
data/g06/g06-018d/g06-018d-04.png	place agree with me better than Naples. The journey

data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-00.png	His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-01.png	communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-02.png	satirical: 'I have not the 1honor of any acquaintance with Mr
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-03.png	Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when Count
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-04.png	Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....'
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-05.png	If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-06.png	Government's other representatives in the islands, while they
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-07.png	warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far to
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-08.png	explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young
data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-09.png	Italian's expense.
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-00.png	In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-01.png	Shelley, Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-02.png	and Tita and the steward, Lega Zambelli, failed to perform
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-03.png	the most elementary duties towards the dead. He pretends
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-04.png	to have found everything in uttermost disorder - 'tokens that
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-05.png	the Pilgrim had most treasured, scattered on the floor, -
data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-06.png	as rubbish of no marketable value, and trampled on'.
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-00.png	This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-01.png	letter to his sister, which was that its chance of reaching its
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-02.png	destination had seemed slight. The collection of Pietro
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-03.png	Gamba's letters deposited among the Murray manuscripts show
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-04.png	that the greatest care was observed in gathering together all the possessions
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-05.png	of a man whose importance was fully recognized by everyone about
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-06.png	him. 'I have had put under Government seal his belongings,
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-07.png	which will be opened by Prince Alexander Mavrocordato
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-08.png	in my presence and that of certain Englishmen who are
data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-09.png	here.
data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-00.png	I have taken an exact inventory of them.' Thus on April 21st, several
data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-01.png	days before Trelawny appeared, Gamba wrote to Lord Sidney Osborne,
data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-02.png	and his inventory has been preserved. The papers were reopened in
data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-03.png	the presence of leading Missolonghi officials in order to make
data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-04.png	sure that no recent will was amongst them.
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-00.png	Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed, and wrote
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-01.png	to Lady Byron after she had received a visit from
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-02.png	him: I have today seen Count Gamba - which was very
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-03.png	distressing for many reasons but quite unavoidable -
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-04.png	he is a pleasing, fine looking young man &amp; spoke
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-05.png	with great feeling. The unfortunate Augusta was
data/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-06.png	in one of her worst states of confusion.
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-00.png	She had loved Byron, but she had betrayed him,
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-01.png	betrayed him not twice, as he had betrayed her,
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-02.png	but again and again over a long span of time,
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-03.png	fawning on his implacable wife, purveying to her
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-04.png	in secret the unguarded letters he never
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-05.png	suspected any eye but her own would see,
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-06.png	feeding the stealthy fires of her animosity:
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-07.png	and having betrayed him, she had grown to
data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-08.png	fear and almost to hate him.
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-00.png	She had dreaded his outpourings of affection for
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-01.png	her in poetry that he thought would clear
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-02.png	her and that only compromised her, and #
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-03.png	the headstrong folly that tempted him to
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-04.png	write on ever more daring themes, teaching
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-05.png	the world to guess what repentance and
data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-06.png	unrepentance preyed upon his thoughts.
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-00.png	She had dreaded still more that he might
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-01.png	return to England, overshadowing her again
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-02.png	with spiritual and social peril. But this kind
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-03.png	of return was what she could never have
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-04.png	foreseen... that he # should come back not
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-05.png	voluble but silent, not beautiful but defaced,
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-06.png	not in obloquy but with his praises ringing!
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-07.png	She could remember now his exciting laughter,
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-08.png	his almost filial love for her, her almost
data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-09.png	maternal love for him.
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-00.png	Above all she could remember the anguish of their
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-01.png	parting, and how he had been 'convulsed, absolutely
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-02.png	convulsed with grief'. So love revived, and in
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-03.png	its most sentimental form. While he lived
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-04.png	she had lost touch in her perpetual alarms
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-05.png	with what was best in him; dead his memory
data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-06.png	became sacred to her.
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-00.png	She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-01.png	# about biographies. Quite apart from the
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-02.png	divagations of her 'poor brother' - so she
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-03.png	constantly referred to him - there were a
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-04.png	hundred reasons why it would be
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-05.png	objectionable to have the family history
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-06.png	exposed. Whatever latitude she allowed in
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-07.png	the warmth of her kindly nature to others -
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-08.png	or to herself - she believed implicitly in
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-09.png	the moral code she had learned from
data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-10.png	her good grandmother, the Countess of
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-00.png	She had no desire to see in print that her
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-01.png	mother, who was to have been a duchess, had
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-02.png	been involved in a scandalous and ruinous
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-03.png	divorce, that her father, 'Mad Jack Byron', was
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-04.png	a profligate and a bankrupt who had
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-05.png	squandered every penny two successive wives
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-06.png	had brought him and left the second on
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-07.png	the verge of destitution, and that he had died
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-08.png	a drunkard and perhaps a suicide, hiding
data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-09.png	in France to escape his creditors.
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-00.png	It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-01.png	Leigh to share this kind of story with the world
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-02.png	than it would be for most 20th-century ladies
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-03.png	moving in court circles and having children to
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-04.png	be settled advantageously in life. She had lived
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-05.png	down the rumours which had made the year of
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-06.png	the Byron separation a nightmare to her, and she
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-07.png	had also succeeded, though with an increasing
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-08.png	sense of effort, in persuading her little world to
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-09.png	avert its eyes from her husband, 'that drone',
data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-10.png	as # Byron called him, whose career of
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-00.png	She had earned the right to be left in peace.
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-01.png	Byron's fame was, of course, very wonderful, but
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-02.png	it carried with it too many reminders of his
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-03.png	terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan,
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-04.png	which she had never ceased to deplore, his
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-05.png	shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement,
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-06.png	his making friends with the atheist known to
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-07.png	her as 'that infamous Mr. Shelley', and his
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-08.png	mixing with really low and horrid people such
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-09.png	as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt, whom
data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-10.png	on would never conceivably meet in decent society.
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-00.png	She was most emphatically opposed to the
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-01.png	production of sheer indelicacies, and that was
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-02.png	the light in which she saw the proposed book
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-03.png	by Dallas. Letters between a mother and a son -
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-04.png	a son so outspoken and a mother so far from
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-05.png	suitable to be paraded before the public!
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-06.png	And brought out by that seedy poor relation,
data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-07.png	Dallas! Could anything be in worse taste?
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-00.png	'Respecting the will', he wrote to Byron's widow a few days after
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-01.png	hearing its contents, 'the very thought of it is painful to me.
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-02.png	What Mary has said about it is too true.' What Mary, the
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-03.png	new Lady Byron, had said about it was written on the first half
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-04.png	sheet of the same paper: My dearest Annabella, The more we
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-05.png	consider the most prominent subject in your letter, the more
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-06.png	we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-07.png	connected with it.
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-00.png	Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-01.png	development corporations, about 20 per cent represents
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-02.png	extensions built after the firms had become established.
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-03.png	It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-04.png	rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-05.png	sites; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-06.png	for factory accommodation.
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-00.png	The average gross return on established industrial estates
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-01.png	ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land,
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-02.png	site works and buildings. Manufacturing industry affords
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-03.png	employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-04.png	manual workers. An analysis made by Crawley Development
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-05.png	Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from fifty-eight
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-06.png	manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff,
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-07.png	showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-08.png	managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as technical
data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-09.png	or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-00.png	There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-01.png	Crawley. The development corporations have aimed at a varied
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-02.png	pattern of industry, offering a reasonable choice of
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-03.png	employer as well as choice of occupation for men, women and
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-04.png	school-leavers, with due regard to the industries
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-05.png	already established in their towns. Inevitably engineering,
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-06.png	including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-07.png	predominates in all the London new towns since these are
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-08.png	among the industries which have expanded most
data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-09.png	during the last ten years in the country generally.
data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-00.png	Of those at present employed in manufacturing industry
data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-01.png	in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are
data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-02.png	employed in engineering and electrical goods manufacture -
data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-03.png	the proportion employed in both these groups combined
data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-04.png	varies from about 30 per cent in Welwyn to 85 per cent in
data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-05.png	Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield.
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-00.png	Questions about marriage and children were
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-01.png	again included, as they had been at the
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-02.png	1911 and 1951 Censuses. The former had asked
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-03.png	for marriage details for all married women,
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-04.png	the latter for all married women under
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-05.png	the age of 50. The 1961 Census questions
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-06.png	related to all women who were or had been
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-07.png	married, and so repeated the enquiry made
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-08.png	fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-09.png	Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-10.png	Commission on Population.
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-00.png	The innovation at the 1961 Census, though the
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-01.png	Family Census had previously included
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-02.png	the question, was the date of termination
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-03.png	of the first or only marriage. This enables
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-04.png	statistical use to be made of their experience
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-05.png	as regards duration of marriage and
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-06.png	number of children in the case of women
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-07.png	whose first or only marriage was terminated
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-08.png	by widowhood or divorce after the end
data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-09.png	of their child bearing life.
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-00.png	This is particularly important in estimating the trends
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-01.png	in the size and pattern of families for successive
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-02.png	generations over as long a period as possible, as the
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-03.png	proportion of widows predominates in the higher age
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-04.png	groups. In Wales and Monmouthshire the question
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-05.png	on the ability to speak Welsh was included as
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-06.png	previously. The question was first asked in 1891, and
data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-07.png	was given its present form in 1931.
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-00.png	Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-01.png	about housing and households. In 1961 the scope of the
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-02.png	question was wider than before, because of the great
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-03.png	use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-04.png	Government and to local authorities. As before, the record
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-05.png	made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residen-
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-06.png	tial premises and temporary places of abode, and all
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-07.png	households occupying them, as the basis of the
data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-08.png	enumeration is the household schedule.
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-00.png	The number of structurally separate dwellings (that is,
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-01.png	houses or flats or other quarters built or adapted for
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-02.png	separate occupation and forming a private and structurally
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-03.png	separate unit) was obtained as previously, together with the
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-04.png	number of households with sole occupation or sharing
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-05.png	such dwellings, and the number of living rooms occu-
data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-06.png	pied by each household.
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-00.png	Previously, while visitors were left out of this
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-01.png	analysis it was not considered sufficiently
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-02.png	important to attempt the task of bringing
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-03.png	in the members away from home on Census
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-04.png	night, which would be very laborious in the
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-05.png	absence of information given at their place
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-06.png	of usual residence (n log n). But the need
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-07.png	for a more accurate distribution of
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-08.png	households by size as usually constituted
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-09.png	had become more important by 1961, and
data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-10.png	accordingly a new question was introduced, ...
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-00.png	As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence, though
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-01.png	we found it an advantage in certain instances. Appendix
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-02.png	1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted. The
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-03.png	Department of Health for Scotland, the Home Office and
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-04.png	the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us;
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-05.png	officers of these Departments attended our meetings
data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-06.png	and have given us valuable assistance.
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-00.png	On 23rd November, 1959, we submitted
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-01.png	an Interim Report. This dealt with two questions
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-02.png	which arose from our terms of reference and
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-03.png	which had been brought specially to our notice.
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-04.png	First, we were asked to examine the risks
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-05.png	attending the abuse of carbromal and
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-06.png	bromvaletone and preparations containing these
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-07.png	substances. The Poisons Board had already
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-08.png	considered this problem but, in the absence of
data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-09.png	sufficient evidence that these compounds
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-00.png	The Thetans must not see him! He took another route
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-01.png	to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-02.png	the way. Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-03.png	once; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-04.png	their situation, as far as it could be assessed,
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-05.png	and to decide on what seemed to be the best
data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-06.png	way of meeting it.
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-00.png	4. On examination of the evidence it became clear
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-01.png	to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-02.png	of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-03.png	were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-04.png	prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951,
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-05.png	or the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1956, and had
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-06.png	not so far been recommended for control as
data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-07.png	poisons.
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-00.png	5. We recommended that, in general, any drug or
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-01.png	pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-02.png	central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-03.png	or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-04.png	on prescription and that an independent expert body
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-05.png	should be responsible for advising which substances
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-06.png	should be so controlled. 6. As an interim and urgent
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-07.png	measure, the Secretary of State for the Home Department,
data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-08.png	on the recommendation of the Poisons Board, has
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-00.png	We are glad to note the action that has been taken
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-01.png	and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-02.png	that, as other preparations affecting the central nervous
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-03.png	system become available, they too will be brought to
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-04.png	the notice of the Poisons Board, or such other advisory
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-05.png	body as may in due course be appointed for the
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-06.png	purpose, to consider whether there are sufficient
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-07.png	grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-08.png	on prescription.
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-00.png	8. The second part of our Interim Report was
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-01.png	devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-02.png	to the gases and vapours which they use in the
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-03.png	course of their professional duties. We
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-04.png	ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-05.png	ity was very small indeed. However, over a
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-06.png	period of eleven years, patients' lives had been
data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-07.png	endangered in two known instances.
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-00.png	We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-01.png	subject that, with the apparatus at present to hand, the
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-02.png	preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-03.png	administering them to a patient was a recognised and
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-04.png	necessary precaution. We accepted this. 10. In view of
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-05.png	the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-06.png	anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-07.png	to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-08.png	entrusted with their administration.
data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-00.png	12. Through the system of records and

data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-03.png	at that time in which exceptionally
data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-04.png	large quantities of morphine and heroin

data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-03.png	on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-04.png	later in this Report. They have, up to now,
data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-05.png	been included in the Memorandum on
data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-06.png	the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-07.png	which is prepared by the Home Office

data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-02.png	were very narrow. For most other
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-03.png	foods younger childless couples paid
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-04.png	the highest average prices and
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-05.png	large families the lowest, the price
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-06.png	gradients being steepest for
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-07.png	carcase meat (+7 to -7 per cent),
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-08.png	"other" fish (+8 to -11), "other" vegetables
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-09.png	(+9 to -9) and beverages other than
data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-10.png	tea (+12 to -16).
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-00.png	Consumption by younger childless couples declined
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-01.png	throughout this period, but that of the smaller families was
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-02.png	maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-03.png	families, particularly those containing four or more children,
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-04.png	there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-05.png	1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated scales of family
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-06.png	allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare
data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-07.png	milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957.
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-00.png	75. The smaller families and the residual groups of
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-01.png	households containing children reduced their consumption
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-02.png	of sugar and of preserves, but in all other types of
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-03.png	household a decline in purchases of the one was
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-04.png	accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other.
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-05.png	76. Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-06.png	the previous year, but consumption was maintained
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-07.png	except in families with more than one child and in
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-08.png	the unclassified households with children or
data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-09.png	adolescents.
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-00.png	All groups except families with four or more children
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-01.png	or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-02.png	vegetables, especially in the first half of the year, although most
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-03.png	reduced their consumption of other vegetables. Purchases of
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-04.png	quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extreme-
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-05.png	ly wide group differences persisted, the averages ranging from
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-06.png	0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-07.png	children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-08.png	households; average consumption by older couples and other
data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-09.png	wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week.
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-00.png	The two latter groups consumed much smaller
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-01.png	quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-02.png	bottled tomatoes than any other group, and much smaller
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-03.png	quantities of canned and bottled fruit than younger
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-04.png	childless couples; in households containing children,
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-05.png	consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-06.png	increasing family size, but there was no regular
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-07.png	gradation in purchases of canned vegetables and canned
data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-08.png	tomatoes.
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-00.png	80. Estimates of the adequacy of the diets, assessed by
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-01.png	comparison with allowances based on the recommendations
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-02.png	of the British Medical Association, are also shown in Table 30.
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-03.png	In comparison with the previous year, changes were small
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-04.png	except for higher estimates for vitamin C. In families with
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-05.png	four or more children the levels of adequacy for all
data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-06.png	nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly.
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-00.png	For this fairly small group, comparisons between different
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-01.png	years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-02.png	defined number of children. In 1959 the households in
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-03.png	this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64)
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-04.png	than in the previous year (average 4.53). Their total food
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-05.png	expenditure increased less than that in other groups,
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-06.png	and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish,
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-07.png	poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-08.png	biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are more
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-09.png	expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-10.png	they purchased less, namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase
data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-11.png	meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat products.
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-00.png	The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-01.png	guard on the jib of the crane, intended to
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-02.png	prevent direct contact with the line, and
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-03.png	electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-04.png	mounted slightly forward of the head of the
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-05.png	jib and with electronic assembly
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-06.png	and warning apparatus in the driver's
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-07.png	cab. Improved designs of both forms
data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-08.png	are being tried out at present.
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-00.png	There is, however, a danger that workers
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-01.png	will rely too much on fixed devices because
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-02.png	they fail to recognise their limitations.
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-03.png	It is therefore safer both in principle and
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-04.png	practice to keep the worker away from
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-05.png	overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-06.png	(1) re-routing the line, (2) putting the supply
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-07.png	underground, (3) making the line
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-08.png	dead (after consultation with the supply
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-09.png	authority), (4) providing barriers at a safe
data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-10.png	distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-00.png	It is also important to remember that on
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-01.png	lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-02.png	from the line may take place without
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-03.png	actual contact. A new type of
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-04.png	machine has recently been developed for
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-05.png	the automatic rolling of sole leather
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-06.png	bends. The sheet of leather is placed
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-07.png	on a sliding feed tray outside the
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-08.png	danger zone and is then pushed
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-09.png	forward between two platens, the upper
data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-10.png	one carrying a set of small rollers.
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-00.png	The lower platen, which supports the
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-01.png	leather, is raised hydraulically to bring
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-02.png	it into contact with the rollers on the upper
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-03.png	platen, which is then caused to make
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-04.png	several horizontal oscillations so that the
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-05.png	leather is rolled and pressed at the same time.
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-06.png	The danger zone between the platens is fenced
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-07.png	by a guard which is interlocked with the
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-08.png	hydraulic valve and the press is also
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-09.png	sequentially operated: the closing of the shutter
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-10.png	starts the machine, the rest of the cycle
data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-11.png	following automatically.
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-00.png	A new method of applying sand to the
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-01.png	faces of green bricks has recently been
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-02.png	developed. In the case of wire-cut bricks
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-03.png	the column of clay from the pug-mill is
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-04.png	carried by a short length of belt
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-05.png	conveyor to the sanding plant.
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-06.png	This consists basically of a vibrating
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-07.png	hopper from which the sand is
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-08.png	distributed to all four faces by a
data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-09.png	system of slots, scrapers and worms.
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-00.png	The conveyor is broken at this point to
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-01.png	enable the sand to be applied to
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-02.png	the under surface of the column, which
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-03.png	passes on through two pairs of
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-04.png	vibrating rollers which embed the sand
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-05.png	firmly in the surfaces and is finally
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-06.png	cut into bricks at the wire cutting
data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-07.png	table.
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-00.png	All stages of Calanus, for example,
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-01.png	seem to migrate on some occasions while
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-02.png	any stage may not on others. Such data
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-03.png	cannot yet be rationalized. Where
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-04.png	information is less extensive, however, it is
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-05.png	possible to find some regularity in the
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-06.png	observations. Thus in Euphausia superba
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-07.png	from the Antarctic, the metanauplii remain
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-08.png	in deep water, the later larval stages
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-09.png	migrate diurnally, and the adolescents
data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-10.png	stay permanently at the surface.
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-00.png	The migrating stages all come from 100-250
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-01.png	meters, and the time of their arrival at
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-02.png	the surface is directly related to their
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-03.png	swimming capacity: 3rd (oldest)
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-04.png	calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr; 2nd,
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-05.png	from 2200-0200 hr; and 1st, from 0200-0600 hr.
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-06.png	Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-07.png	in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-08.png	at the surface while the young migrate
data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-09.png	to and from a depth of 50 meters.
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-00.png	Such permanent occurrence at the surface
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-01.png	could of course be considered the extreme
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-02.png	of a variable day depth. The effect of
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-03.png	day depths upon the surfacing of various
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-04.png	animals has been reviewed elsewhere. c.
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-05.png	Anomalies. In spite of the variability
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-06.png	of migrational behavior, some kinds
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-07.png	of anomalies may be recognized.
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-08.png	Vertical movement occurs in some forms
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-09.png	apparently in the reverse manner to
data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-10.png	that commonly met.
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-00.png	Such reversed migrations are known for
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-01.png	Acartia clausi, A. longiremis, Nyctiphanes
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-02.png	couchii, Evadne sp., Oithona nana, Daphnia
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-03.png	lumholzi, Stages 4, 5, and adult of
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-04.png	Calanus finmarchicus, Diaptomus banforanus,
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-05.png	and Cyclops bicuspidatus. An echo-producing
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-06.png	layer, which the authors think probably consists
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-07.png	of euphausiids, has also been described
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-08.png	as, in part, regularly moving in a reverse
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-09.png	manner. Most of these records are well
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-10.png	substantiated and involve whole populations
data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-11.png	rather than aberrant individuals.
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-00.png	These figures are much higher than the national
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-01.png	averages, and may be thought to indicate a
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-02.png	lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-03.png	hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-04.png	skilled employment and are highly diversified
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-05.png	as regards products, markets and methods of
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-06.png	manufacture. Consumer goods industries such as the
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-07.png	manufacture of food # and drink, tobacco, clothing
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-08.png	and footwear are under-represented in the new
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-09.png	towns generally though not in Basildon and
data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-10.png	Welwyn.
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-00.png	The following table indicates the size of the
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-01.png	firms, some of them occupying more than
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-02.png	one factory, introduced or sponsored by
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-03.png	development corporations in the new towns: The
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-04.png	overall average for the factories sponsored by
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-05.png	development corporations is about 170 employees
data/h07/h07-017/h07-017-06.png	per firm, and the average for each of the London

data/h07/h07-051b/h07-051b-03.png	In practice it has not proved possible

data/h07/h07-087/h07-087-00.png	Tables C, D and E of Appendix 16 give details of
data/h07/h07-087/h07-087-01.png	factories, shops and offices completed and under
data/h07/h07-087/h07-087-02.png	construction at the end of the year.
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-00.png	This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-01.png	obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-02.png	aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-03.png	for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's,
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-04.png	the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-05.png	became established for aero-engine radiators, using
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-06.png	dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages
data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-07.png	were separated by flat plates.
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-00.png	This development coincided with the introduction of
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-01.png	pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-02.png	cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-03.png	coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-04.png	were of comparable magnitude, the use of
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-05.png	secondary surface was still attractive, since the
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-06.png	greater part of the surface area could be made up
data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-07.png	of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-00.png	Furthermore, developments in the detail form of
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-01.png	the fins made possible a reduction in the total
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-02.png	surface area required as compared with the use of
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-03.png	smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-04.png	duty and pressure losses. The properties of
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-05.png	compact form, low weight, and design flexibility
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-06.png	thus developed found ready application on a
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-07.png	much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-08.png	scale air separation plants.
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-00.png	The basic method of construction is both simple and
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-01.png	extremely flexible. Figure 3 illustrates the
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-02.png	arrangement of a single passage. This can be
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-03.png	extended in length and width up to the limit of
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-04.png	manufacturing equipment available. The corrugation
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-05.png	is machine-formed, thus ensuring a high standard
data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-06.png	of uniformity in height and fin pitch.
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-00.png	Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-01.png	material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-02.png	oxidise the cell can only be used as has been
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-03.png	suggested above, as an oxygen concentration monitor.
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-04.png	However, if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-05.png	oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-06.png	at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-07.png	in the coolant circuit for that material would be
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-08.png	indicated by a negative or positive potential at the
data/j01/j01-042/j01-042-09.png	reference electrode.
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-00.png	Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-01.png	circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-02.png	electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated

data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-04.png	solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-05.png	the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-06.png	conditions for niobium and positive voltage, non-
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-07.png	oxidizing conditions. The practical application of
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-08.png	the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
data/j01/j01-045/j01-045-09.png	tion before it can be realised.
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-00.png	The first requirement is for an anionic
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-01.png	electrolyte, which can be fabricated into
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-02.png	suitable shapes impervious to gases and
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-03.png	liquid sodium and which is neither
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-04.png	corroded by sodium nor by sodium
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-05.png	monoxide. Possible materials are zirconia
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-06.png	stabilised with lime and thoria doped
data/j01/j01-049/j01-049-07.png	with rare earth oxides.
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-00.png	This resulted in the oxidation of the
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-01.png	-ve electrode and reduction of the +ve
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-02.png	electrode which of course led to a loss in
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-03.png	E.M.F. from the cell. In the above design the two
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-04.png	electrodes are completely separated from one
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-05.png	another so that this major source of
data/j01/j01-070/j01-070-06.png	trouble should not be present.
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-00.png	The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-01.png	ingrowth over two half-lives (ten days). Therefore
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-02.png	after a further forty days, the bismuth daughter
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-03.png	will be within 0.1 sources are required for use sooner
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-04.png	than forty or fifty days after preparation, the
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-05.png	lead-210 together with added lead carrier must
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-06.png	be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-07.png	ion exchange (see Analytical Method, steps 4, 5)
data/j04/j04-008/j04-008-08.png	before precipitating lead chromate.
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-00.png	Knowing the time of separation and the
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-01.png	activity of the lead-210 solution, the ingrowth
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-02.png	of the bismuth-210 can be calculated. The
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-03.png	absolute activity of the reference standards
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-04.png	can be calculated from the known activity
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-05.png	of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-06.png	yield, but this calculation is unnecessary
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-07.png	provided the same lead carrier solution is
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-08.png	used to prepare the reference standards
data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-09.png	and for the analyses.
data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-00.png	The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed
data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-01.png	for ten days and showed no abnormalities.
data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-02.png	Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha-

data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-06.png	There was no significant difference between the-
data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-07.png	se results and those obtained using the original
data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-08.png	lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical
data/j04/j04-019/j04-019-09.png	Centre which we concluded was radiochemi-

data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-00.png	Rosenquist (4) showed that minute quantities of
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-01.png	lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu-
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-02.png	tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-03.png	sulphate. Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-04.png	stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-05.png	is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-06.png	of the strontium sulphate is incomplete. Using
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-07.png	ten milligrams of lead carrier and six
data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-08.png	hundred milligrams of strontium per liter,

data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-00.png	Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-01.png	minimum but the accuracy and precision of
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-02.png	weighing the precipitated sources suffers. All
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-03.png	precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-04.png	which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-05.png	weights from the National Physical Laboratory.
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-06.png	Complete chemical exchange between the
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-07.png	radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-08.png	necessary if the analytical results are to
data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-09.png	be correct.
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-00.png	The presence and growth of algae in the
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-01.png	alkaline effluent does not prevent the
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-02.png	recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-03.png	conditions although some radioactivity remains
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-04.png	on the algae until the metathesis has been
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-05.png	completed by heating the mixed sulphates
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-06.png	with three separate portions of dilute (1.25
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-07.png	normal) sodium carbonate solution. The
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-08.png	strength of the carbonate solution was
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-09.png	chosen after experiments with lead tracer
data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-10.png	alone which indicated that less lead was
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-00.png	In the preliminary experiments, the tracer was added to a
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-01.png	liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-02.png	strontium sulphate from hot solution. Chemical exchange
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-03.png	was complete under these conditions; but when the tracer
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-04.png	was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-05.png	stand for several days before the addition of lead
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-06.png	carrier, the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-07.png	per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery
data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-08.png	of the carrier.
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-00.png	A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-01.png	cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle. The
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-02.png	sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-03.png	to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-04.png	convert the resin completely to the chloride form.
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-05.png	The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
data/j04/j04-053/j04-053-06.png	remove the acid and finally dried in air.

data/j04/j04-061/j04-061-01.png	diameter. One end of the tube is drawn down to a fine
data/j04/j04-061/j04-061-02.png	tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the
data/j04/j04-061/j04-061-03.png	other end as shown in Figure 1. The reservoir is a 50 ml
data/j04/j04-061/j04-061-04.png	cylindrical separating funnel with a capillary tap
data/j04/j04-061/j04-061-05.png	modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the
data/j04/j04-061/j04-061-06.png	glass column.
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-00.png	The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-01.png	experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-02.png	(lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve is shown in
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-03.png	Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-04.png	of resin used is also fixed. All available evidence indicates
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-05.png	that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-06.png	of cross contamination apart from the natural
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-07.png	ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-08.png	lead.
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-00.png	Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-01.png	interfere. Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-02.png	and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-03.png	the first wash. The resin is used for a single
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-04.png	separation and then thrown away. In the first stage
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-05.png	of the analysis, only the fraction containing
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-06.png	lead-210 is collected. The lead is precipitated as
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-07.png	the chromate, washed, slurried onto an aluminium
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-08.png	counting tray, dried under an infra-red lamp,
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-09.png	weighed, and set aside for five days while the
data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-10.png	bismuth-210 grows in.
data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-00.png	At the end of five days, bismuth-210 will have
data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-01.png	reached one-half of its equilibrium value and
data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-02.png	can be counted through an aluminium absorber
data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-03.png	sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles
data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-04.png	from lead-210 and the alpha particles from
data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-05.png	polonium-210.
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-00.png	This loss is acceptably small for an analytical
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-01.png	step when no correction for carrier
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-02.png	recovery is possible. The completeness
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-03.png	of the chemical exchange between the
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-04.png	bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-05.png	also tested. Two samples of precipitated
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-06.png	lead chromate (lead-210, bismuth-210)
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-07.png	were counted and dissolved in nitric
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-08.png	acid in silica basins. The contents
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-09.png	were evaporated to dryness with
data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-10.png	bismuth carrier and then taken up in
data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-00.png	The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the
data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-01.png	phosphate. Results did not differ from those obtained by the more

data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-03.png	mates in 2 N hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes. The more
data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-04.png	rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary.
data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-05.png	Lead-210 when present in effluent is likely to be found

data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-02.png	result from active swimming
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-03.png	although passive movement through
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-04.png	the water has been suggested on
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-05.png	various grounds. For example,
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-06.png	transport in vertical currents
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-07.png	resulting from temperature diff-
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-08.png	erences has been proposed; diff-
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-09.png	erences in water viscosity after
data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-10.png	temperature changes have also been
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-00.png	Downward movement may in some forms
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-01.png	start as a passive sinking, especially
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-02.png	when it occurs before dawn; but this
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-03.png	must almost certainly be replaced
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-04.png	by the headfirst downward swimming
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-05.png	observed in the field. 3. Initiating,
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-06.png	controlling, and orienting factors. The
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-07.png	primary dependence of diurnal
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-08.png	migrations upon changes in light intensity
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-09.png	is beyond doubt. Yet in spite
data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-10.png	of a great amount of work,
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-00.png	Loeb first suggested the importance
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-01.png	of light as the governing factor
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-02.png	but combined its influence with that
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-03.png	of gravity. Later authors, in particular
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-04.png	Rose, have proposed that light
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-05.png	alone can provide an adequate
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-06.png	mechanism if the animals have,
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-07.png	and select by exploration, a
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-08.png	zone of optimum light intensity.
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-09.png	This view has been enlarged
data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-10.png	with a suggestion that both
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-00.png	The air passages were packed with corrugated
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-01.png	foil bonded to the primary plates to
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-02.png	provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer.
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-03.png	The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil,
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-04.png	chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-05.png	the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-06.png	dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-07.png	for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
data/j07/j07-005/j07-005-08.png	weight reductions as compared with copper construction.
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-00.png	Though that was not quite the phrase, for even
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-01.png	if he could succeed Sir Charles he would, as
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-02.png	an executive, be eternally differentiated from
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-03.png	the Governors. Fairbanks managed the Governors
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-04.png	beautifully, he knew more than they, he was
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-05.png	cleverer than most, discreetly used their Christian
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-06.png	names - but remained their servant. They had
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-07.png	no office hours, however elastic; their lives were
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-08.png	spent in committee making decisions for others
data/k01/k01-051/k01-051-09.png	to execute on the basis of data laboriously
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-00.png	The gin pahits, and now the beer with the
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-01.png	curry, had their desired effect on us;
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-02.png	or rather, on Nigel and myself. Lee, I
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-03.png	noticed, had asked for Coca-Cola. This
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-04.png	rather surprised me from a young man
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-05.png	who was otherwise so sophisticated. He
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-06.png	was not, however, ostentatious about
data/k02/k02-018/k02-018-07.png	the matter.
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-00.png	'Not at all. I'll show you.' 'Oh no,'
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-01.png	young Lee protested, considerate as always.
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-02.png	'That's not necessary if you want to rest, sir.
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-03.png	I'm sure I won't do any harm.' Nigel
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-04.png	laughed. I had not known he was so
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-05.png	good-natured. But then, I suppose I had
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-06.png	never given him similar cause to display
data/k02/k02-036/k02-036-07.png	such amiability.
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-00.png	I slept soundly, and much later than I should. It
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-01.png	was already after six when I awoke, and the sun
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-02.png	was nearly setting beyond the west window.
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-03.png	Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices,
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-04.png	and knew they were back. I wondered, as I
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-05.png	wrapped a 6sarong around my waist, if
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-06.png	Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
data/k02/k02-053/k02-053-07.png	afternoon sleep.
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-00.png	And I said to myself: Oh, God, doesn't the
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-01.png	boy ever relax! He turned his gaze away
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-02.png	from me almost instantly, but it had
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-03.png	been enough to make me conscious of the
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-04.png	nakedness of the upper half of my body, even
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-05.png	of the matted grey hairs on my chest. He
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-06.png	probably thought my appearance quite a breach
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-07.png	of the social graces; but, naturally, he said
data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-08.png	not so much as a word about it.
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-00.png	'We've just had tea,' Nigel said. 'Would you like
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-01.png	the cookie to make you a fresh lot?' 'I'd rather
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-02.png	have whisky,' I told him. 'Thought as much.
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-03.png	Sun's nearly below the yard-arm, anyway.
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-04.png	Wouldn't mind a stengah myself. How about
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-05.png	you, Harry?' So they had managed to come
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-06.png	to the stage of using each other's Christian
data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-07.png	names, I noted.
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-00.png	Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-01.png	reserved as I thought. 'Thanks,
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-02.png	Nigel,' he said. 'Just Coca-Cola.
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-03.png	Although I'd like to have
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-04.png	whatever you have. I want to
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-05.png	get to know the kind of life
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-06.png	people lead in the East, you know.'
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-07.png	At this, I felt a return of the
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-08.png	irritation I felt with him
data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-09.png	at times.
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-00.png	I shrugged a shoulder. Lee would have
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-01.png	to decide about that for himself, I
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-02.png	thought, and noticed that although he
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-03.png	was looking at the other girl, he did
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-04.png	so quite dispassionately, almost as though
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-05.png	he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-06.png	clothes she was wearing. And I thought
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-07.png	to myself: He may be still too much of
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-08.png	a 'new chum' to see 'the beauty of
data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-09.png	the East'.
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-00.png	There was still an ease in our conversation, but its
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-01.png	scope was restricted. I felt that I could hardly make the
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-02.png	usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-03.png	as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-04.png	wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment.
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-05.png	And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few drinks,
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-06.png	then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-07.png	dinner.
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-00.png	He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-01.png	the floor. His pictures and curtains, indeed I
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-02.png	suppose the entire furnishings, had been se-
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-03.png	lected personally. The house was, as he
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-04.png	occasionally proclaimed, his home - and he had
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-05.png	made it as such. I doubt if he will ever
data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-06.png	leave Malaya, even when he retires.
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-00.png	The country, and his mistresses, have come
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-01.png	to mean too much to him. And, indirectly,
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-02.png	this impression I had of him was one of several
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-03.png	reasons why I had decided I should leave
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-04.png	it - before, for me too, it would be too late.
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-05.png	I used the excuse of our early start in the
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-06.png	morning to retire as soon as it seemed
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-07.png	prudent to do so, after the coffee and brandy,
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-08.png	already anticipating the familiar pleasures
data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-09.png	awaiting me.
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-00.png	I don't mean just our direct military costs. I'm
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-01.png	thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up.
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-02.png	I'm afraid, Prime Minister, you're not going to like the
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-03.png	trading position when you see it.' 'I never do,' the
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-04.png	Prime Minister commented wearily. The Chancellor
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-05.png	was repeating an argument which he had already
data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-06.png	developed for an hour before lunch.
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-00.png	'It comes at a bad time,' said
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-01.png	Ormston. 'A singularly bad time. The
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-02.png	Party's very restless, you know.' 'It
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-03.png	is a sign of life - very encouraging!'
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-04.png	'The younger men -' 'Which ones?'
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-05.png	'The younger ones like Gore, Vaughan,
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-06.png	Hadley, Prebble, Lambert-Price - the
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-07.png	New Africa lot -' 'Do they confide
data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-08.png	in you? Have you spoken to them?'
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-00.png	'Only at yesterday's meeting - they're very restless, Prime
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-01.png	Minister. They feel that it's very old-fashioned - shooting
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-02.png	down mobs of natives. They're very much afraid that
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-03.png	if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-04.png	rather dismal stuff is going to come out.'
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-05.png	'Young back-benchers are always restive when they're
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-06.png	bored,' said the Prime Minister, and for the first
data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-07.png	time since his grandchildren left the table, he smiled.
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-00.png	'Why don't you give them something to play with?'
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-01.png	'They've found their own toy,' said Ormston,
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-02.png	'and this is it. They want to abstain next week.'
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-03.png	The Prime Minister continued in his flippant
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-04.png	tone, 'Tell the Chief to give them a
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-05.png	talking-to.' The Chancellor closed his eyes,
data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-06.png	and then said,
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-00.png	'I think it's gone beyond that, Prime Minister.
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-01.png	They feel pretty strongly about Africa. They are greatly
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-02.png	disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-03.png	the Party which our African policy is creating.
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-04.png	On the whole, the country is still in favour
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-05.png	of moderation and common sense. Melville has
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-06.png	in a curious way made us look old-fashioned
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-07.png	- extravagant - nineteenth centuryish -
data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-08.png	almost cranky.'
data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-00.png	As he turned aside his head, since he could not
data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-01.png	bear to look at her beautiful, pleading face, he was
data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-02.png	suddenly attacked by suspicion. 'You wish to marry
data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-03.png	someone else!' he cried in a voice roughened by
data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-04.png	jealousy. She sighed deeply, and looked away. 'Do you?
data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-05.png	Do you?' he repeated, fiercely.
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-00.png	'Be careful,' she whispered from behind her fan.
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-01.png	'Olimpia is watching us. The young man with her is
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-02.png	Orlando Cavalcanti, Francesco's friend.' Orsini
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-03.png	shot an impatient glance at the couple. 'The young man
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-04.png	with the mole?' 'Yes, indeed.' 'No matter. They are not
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-05.png	looking at us. Now I must know,' he whispered, 'what
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-06.png	you meant, cara mia. Do you want your freedom in order
data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-07.png	to marry?'
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-00.png	'If,' she said gently, giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing,
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-01.png	'if I wished to marry some young gallant, do you think I would
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-02.png	ask your help? You would be the last man I would ask.' Before
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-03.png	he could collect his wits to reply to this, there was a bustle
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-04.png	and confusion at the end of the room. Prince Doria had
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-05.png	wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted
data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-06.png	coffer.
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-00.png	The party was now preparing to see
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-01.png	the tapestries, and in the general
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-02.png	movement, Vittoria was separated from
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-03.png	Orsini. Although neither of them
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-04.png	wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-05.png	no alternative. As she was about to mount
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-06.png	a wide and shallow flight of marble
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-07.png	stairs, she became aware of someone
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-08.png	watching her intently, and turning
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-09.png	in that direction, she saw Olimpia,
data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-10.png	standing beside her admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti.
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-00.png	The young man was bending over her with the
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-01.png	assiduity of a lover, but the girl appeared to be more
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-02.png	interested in her cousin's wife, whom she was regarding
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-03.png	through half-closed eyes. This was a slight shock to
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-04.png	Vittoria, who had forgotten the existence of the girl,
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-05.png	and, up to this moment had been unaware of the
data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-06.png	young man's presence at the palazzo.
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-00.png	Before replying to this, she glanced
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-01.png	hastily around, then spoke in tones so low that he
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-02.png	had to bend his head to hear: 'I will never be
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-03.png	any man's mistress. As to marrying again ...
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-04.png	if I were free ... there is only one man I would
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-05.png	wish to marry ... but ... he, like myself, is now
data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-06.png	bound.'
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-00.png	With a swift gesture she closed her fan
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-01.png	and moved away from him towards the group
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-02.png	in the centre of the gallery, leaving him standing
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-03.png	alone, against that glowing, barbaric background,
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-04.png	with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face.
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-05.png	On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-06.png	the visit to the Doria Palace, the cardinal's
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-07.png	coach left the villa, lurched over the unpaved
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-08.png	track and turned towards the ruined Baths
data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-09.png	of Diocletian.
data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-00.png	He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-01.png	custom, and dwell there with their relations. Her
data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-02.png	values were those of the materialist who assesses
data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-03.png	every human being in terms of fame, power and
data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-04.png	wealth. Francesco she despised for his dullness, his
data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-05.png	lack of initiative, his subservience to his uncle.
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-00.png	Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-01.png	love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-02.png	futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-03.png	her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-04.png	first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-05.png	She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-06.png	Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-07.png	come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits
data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-08.png	with a weight of misgiving.
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-00.png	She had, perhaps, demanded too much. The
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-01.png	kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-02.png	pected depths in her, and she knew that
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-03.png	if she yielded to him, her passion could,
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-04.png	indeed, match his. Every instinct urged her to
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-05.png	surrender, for there was that in his nature
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-06.png	to which her own had responded as it
data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-07.png	had responded to no other human being.
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-00.png	Prudence, ambition and reason had
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-01.png	held instinct in check, and they must
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-02.png	dictate her course. There could be no
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-03.png	compromise. For a brief interval
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-04.png	she allowed herself the luxury of
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-05.png	dreams. She began to imagine life at
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-06.png	Bracciano, the balls and fe*?5tes, the
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-07.png	conversation of poets and dilettanti. She
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-08.png	visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-09.png	ment, and herself on the ducal dais beside
data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-10.png	Orsini, placing a chaplet of roses on the brows
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-00.png	She shrugged her shoulders, and replied in the same
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-01.png	language: 'Yes. But make it worth her while.'
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-02.png	'I see. I know how to deal with people like that,'
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-03.png	and turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-04.png	own language. 'Do you know who I am?' 'No,
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-05.png	signor,' she whispered. 'I am the Orsini. My word is
data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-06.png	law in Rome.'
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-00.png	Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat.
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-01.png	Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-02.png	sombrely: 'Have you ever heard of a punishment called
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-03.png	the cord?' She blanched and shrank away. Was there not
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-04.png	a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-05.png	where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty,
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-06.png	sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-07.png	their arms were wrenched from their sockets. 'You have
data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-08.png	heard of it?
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-00.png	The Orsini give that to traitors. There is
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-01.png	no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-02.png	a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-03.png	power can save him ... or her. Do you understand?'
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-04.png	'Yes, signor,' she faltered. 'On the other hand,' he
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-05.png	continued, giving her a keen look, 'the Orsini are
data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-06.png	generous to those who serve them faithfully.
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-00.png	Remember that, my girl.' Lucia was beyond
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-01.png	speech. He turned to Vittoria, sitting erect,
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-02.png	with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-03.png	anger. 'And now, madonna,' he said smoothly, 'we will
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-04.png	continue the conversation started at the Doria
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-05.png	Palace. Be pleased to alight.' 'I think,' she replied
data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-06.png	coolly, 'I prefer to stay where I am.'
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-00.png	He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-01.png	led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-02.png	had never trodden. He learned how to use his
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-03.png	hands, how to adore that body without haste, how
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-04.png	to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-05.png	creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-06.png	himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-07.png	dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened
data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-08.png	his heart beat to a thunder.
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-00.png	He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair,
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-01.png	her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-02.png	heart in the full throat. Her mouth did things he
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-03.png	thought no human being could stand without
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-04.png	dying, but he went on living in an ocean of
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-05.png	voluptuousness, that swelled and ebbed over him,
data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-06.png	under him, in him and through him...
data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-00.png	He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with
data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-01.png	shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking
data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-02.png	a cigarette. His face was white with two red
data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-03.png	blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely. O.K. teacher!
data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-04.png	Was that any better? You know it was! You don't
data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-05.png	need teaching, only a little coaxing.
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-00.png	He sat down and ran his finger down along her
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-01.png	spine. Do you love me now? Like yesterday! I'm
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-02.png	extremely fond of you. The fact that you're beginning
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-03.png	to satisfy my physical wants does not change that.
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-04.png	Before long you'll give me the satisfaction that'll set
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-05.png	me rocking on my feet, but I'll still be only fond of
data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-06.png	you. But you wouldn't marry me?
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-00.png	No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-01.png	mean that. I'd very probably be unfaithful and
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-02.png	that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-03.png	you a lesson. It wouldn't work. You'd do it to
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-04.png	spite me. I would never do it for that reason.
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-05.png	To me it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate
data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-06.png	or not. You'd go crazy if that situation arose.
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-00.png	You perverted sex-maniac, you wouldn't
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-01.png	dare. Show me what you can do and
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-02.png	I'll tell you if you need help.
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-03.png	Once he came back to the subject
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-04.png	of her marriage and asked her why
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-05.png	she was going to marry her sculptor.
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-06.png	Because I love him, of course.
data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-07.png	What do you think?
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-00.png	But he's a lot older, isn't he?
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-01.png	I suppose so. What attracts you?
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-02.png	It can't be physical? Of course
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-03.png	not! I love him for what he is
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-04.png	- he's so great I'm a bit scared
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-05.png	of him - a woman must be a bit
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-06.png	scared to be really in love.
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-07.png	That's why you could never
data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-08.png	love me?
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-00.png	Correct, ducky! You just wait till
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-01.png	you meet the girl who thinks you're a
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-02.png	god. It'll make you feel like one!
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-03.png	You think that sculptor's a god?
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-04.png	Perhaps, in a way. All I know is
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-05.png	that I need him. He kissed the
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-06.png	heart beat in her throat. But how
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-07.png	about the physical side? You're
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-08.png	quite an erotic little beast; can
data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-09.png	he satisfy that?
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-00.png	You youngsters always overestimate
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-01.png	yourselves. You can take it from
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-02.png	me that he can and does. But
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-03.png	even if he were impotent I'd still
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-04.png	love and want him. There are
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-05.png	sides to me you'll never know.
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-06.png	Don't you feel guilty living with
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-07.png	me? Often! Don't you? Mary had
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-08.png	married her bill broker some time
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-09.png	ago and he now shuddered when he
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-10.png	remembered the clinical weekends
data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-11.png	he used to spend with her.
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-00.png	He often used to try to imagine
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-01.png	her reactions if he had once treated
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-02.png	her as he did Charlie, but his
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-03.png	imagination failed. The efficient
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-04.png	little Mary would probably have
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-05.png	called it a shocking waste of time
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-06.png	and told him to get down to
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-07.png	business! Charlie, who was perfectly
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-08.png	at home at all sorts of artistic
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-09.png	circles, had amongst others wangled
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-10.png	him a membership ticket for a
data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-11.png	small club for artists only.
data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-00.png	One of the small ones. Sark, that's it. The Caxtons
data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-01.png	used to have their holidays there. Starmouth went
data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-02.png	there. He dug out some people who remembered
data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-03.png	the family. In the end he pieced it all together.
data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-04.png	The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek.
data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-05.png	Pete first met them at school.
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-00.png	It was a good school I sent him to, one of the best.
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-01.png	He was a boarder. He could always turn on the
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-02.png	charm when it suited him. The whole family
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-03.png	came to like him. The real Michael - he was the
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-04.png	same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-05.png	was eighteen. Soon after that Pete staged his
data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-06.png	drowning.
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-00.png	He was always a smooth liar. He invented some
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-01.png	plausible story or other and threw himself on
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-02.png	the Caxtons' generosity. They accepted him as a
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-03.png	kind of substitute for the boy they had lost.
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-04.png	Outside the family he began to pass himself
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-05.png	off as Michael Caxton. The father was well-off
data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-06.png	and easy-going. He was easy meat for Pete.
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-00.png	My chance had come at last. I had to
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-01.png	take it. I was going to smash him as
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-02.png	he had twice tried to smash me. (His
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-03.png	eyes, wild and frightened, were fixed on
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-04.png	Tong. Tong guessed that they did not
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-05.png	see him.) I told Starmouth to go at
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-06.png	once and report exactly what he had
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-07.png	seen to Dackson and his daughter.
data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-08.png	He did as he was told.
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-00.png	Carol Carstairs, interviewed by
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-01.png	Passon and Tong for the second time,
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-02.png	began by agreeing that she could
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-03.png	have been mistaken about the
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-04.png	precise minute of Dackson's visit
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-05.png	the previous Wednesday, and ended
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-06.png	by admitting that he was in fact
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-07.png	at least half an hour late for
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-08.png	his appointment with her. &quot;There
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-09.png	it is,&quot; Passon commented
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-10.png	afterwards. &quot;She is a business
data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-11.png	woman.
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-00.png	When Nick returned home he found that his
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-01.png	mother was seriously ill. She had pneumonia. The
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-02.png	sight of her youngest son, the doctor said, was the
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-03.png	only thing that saved her; it gave her the strength
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-04.png	she needed to fight for life. Soon she was out of
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-05.png	danger, but the doctor told Dan that she would
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-06.png	have to remain in bed for some time and
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-07.png	that thereafter it was essential that she should
data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-08.png	not have to exert herself.
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-00.png	With Grace helpless Rose set up her
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-01.png	own autocracy. Her squeaking, querulous
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-02.png	accents were heard without inter-
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-03.png	mission. They rose over the baby's inter-
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-04.png	minable howling and were directed at
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-05.png	everyone in equal measure. She was
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-06.png	a poor and unpunctual cook. Normally
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-07.png	indolent, she was now and again seized
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-08.png	with unpredictable bouts of energy in
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-09.png	the grip of which she swept through
data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-10.png	the house with a fury that disarranged
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-00.png	Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother, beckoned
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-01.png	him to stand closer, and whispered into his
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-02.png	ear the most unexpected words Nick had
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-03.png	ever heard. &quot;I'm going to get myself
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-04.png	married,&quot; Fred said. The next day he
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-05.png	brought home a woman in her middle
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-06.png	thirties and took her straight to his
data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-07.png	mother's bedside.
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-00.png	"Mum, this is Maggie. I'm going to marry her,
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-01.png	and I'd like her to come and live with us."
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-02.png	Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-03.png	smile, a placid nature, and a slow-moving
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-04.png	but methodical mind. For twenty years she
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-05.png	had worked in the bottling-store at the bre-
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-06.png	wery, and Grace heard with astonishment
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-07.png	that Fred had known her on and off
data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-08.png	for nearly as long.
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-00.png	It was Nick who found the answer. &quot;Only
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-01.png	one thing for it, Mum,&quot; he said, sitting on
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-02.png	the edge of the bed and holding one
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-03.png	of her hands in his. &quot;Let Fred and
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-04.png	Mag have the two upstairs rooms
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-05.png	between them. Sam will have to
data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-06.png	come out of his kennel.
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-00.png	He argued that it was the only place where
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-01.png	he could be safe from Rose. &quot;See here, Sam,&quot;
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-02.png	Nick began. &quot;You know Fred's getting spliced.&quot;
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-03.png	&quot;Gone soft in the head,&quot; Sam said. &quot;Same as
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-04.png	I've always said, women rule the roost and
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-05.png	no man's safe from 'em. Ought to be a
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-06.png	better way of doing things. Take trees.&quot; He
data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-07.png	rattled on very happily.
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-00.png	He propped himself on one elbow. &quot;You can't
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-01.png	do it to me, Nick. I've worked this room up to
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-02.png	my way of thinking like I'd educate a child.
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-03.png	This room and me understands one another.&quot;
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-04.png	&quot;Sam,&quot; Nick said firmly, &quot;either you and
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-05.png	me share downstairs, and we have Mag, or
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-06.png	you stick it out up here and we all get
data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-07.png	saddled with the First Flower for ever.&quot;
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-00.png	&quot;She's as good a worker as you could wish for.
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-01.png	She speaks our language. Mag's one of us.&quot;
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-02.png	Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-03.png	amicably. The old man, though fighting a
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-04.png	grumbling rearguard action, permitted himself
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-05.png	gradually to become a little cleaner and
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-06.png	tidier. In his heart he was well satisfied to
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-07.png	have Nick's company. When they were alone
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-08.png	together he often explained all over again
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-09.png	how shrewd he had been in discovering
data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-10.png	Alf Jesty's secret.
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-00.png	"It certainly was, Sam," Nick would agree, and go
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-01.png	on to say with a touch of self-importance: "No
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-02.png	wonder he tried to have me suffocated back
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-03.png	last summer. Must have thought I'd
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-04.png	rumbled him right from the start." By this
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-05.png	time Nick was certain in his own mind
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-06.png	that he had really seen Caxton's hand
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-07.png	snatching at the prop holding the barge's
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-08.png	hatch open, though he could never prove it,
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-09.png	and it would not be of much use if
data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-10.png	he could.
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-00.png	The nose is one of the most pain-sensitive
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-01.png	organs in the human body - and
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-02.png	Malone was discovering the truth in
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-03.png	scientific detail. Kennan had only
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-04.png	seconds left. He jumped forward to
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-05.png	the far limit of his chain, his
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-06.png	right hand chopping edge-downwards
data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-07.png	in bone-jarring force.
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-00.png	The blow took the writhing thug a fraction
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-01.png	above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-02.png	plexus, the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-03.png	Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-04.png	combat targets. The thug collapsed with a whistling
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-05.png	moan, and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-06.png	suddenly limp hand. There was no time for
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-07.png	rejoicing, but the hard, firm shape of the
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-08.png	automatic sent a new confidence surging through
data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-09.png	his body.
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-00.png	Shouts, and the clatter of feet meant
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-01.png	Goldie and Leo Grundy were on their
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-02.png	way. Kennan pulled the manacle chain
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-03.png	taut, and blasted two shots at the
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-04.png	link which tied him to the ring-bolt in
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-05.png	the rock. The nine-millimetre bullets sma-
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-06.png	shed the chain as if it had been plastic,
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-07.png	and, free, though the chain still dangled,
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-08.png	he threw himself across the floor
data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-09.png	towards the entrance.
data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-00.png	'Well, what do you think?' she scoffed, her
data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-01.png	brilliant eyes challenging him. He made no answer.
data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-02.png	There was nothing to be said. He lifted his glass
data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-03.png	and drained it, feeling the sweat breaking out on the
data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-04.png	palms of his hands.
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-00.png	When at last he looked up she was standing right
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-01.png	in front of him, smiling as if nothing had happened!
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-02.png	He could hardly believe it and blinked several times.
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-03.png	'Well, don't I get a drink tonight?' she asked boldly.
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-04.png	'Of course... anything you like', he murmured,
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-05.png	relief flooding over him. 'Kitty... I'm sorry....'
data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-06.png	His throat went tight and words failed him.
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-00.png	'Aw, forget it', she said cheerfully. 'I'll sting
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-01.png	you for a double for being a naughty boy.
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-02.png	How about the telly tomorrow afternoon?'
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-03.png	He felt a glow of happiness steal over him.
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-04.png	Everything was all right now, thank God. She
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-05.png	wasn't going to break with him, after all.
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-06.png	For the moment it was the only thing in the
data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-07.png	world that mattered.
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-00.png	'Of course, Kitty', he said fervently, his eyes misty
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-01.png	behind their thick lenses. 'Well, I'll be off now. See you
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-02.png	tomorrow... and thank you....' 'So long, Bob', she said,
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-03.png	waving her hand to him. Harry followed him to the
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-04.png	door, opened it for him and stood outside on the step,
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-05.png	looking up at the sky, where a few pale stars shone
data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-06.png	between puffs of light cumulus cloud.
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-00.png	'Nice night', he remarked affably. 'But they forecast rain
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-01.png	for tomorrow.' 'Do they?' Bone glanced up at the sky, his
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-02.png	thoughts elsewhere. Personally, he didn't care if it rained cats
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-03.png	and dogs and he knew that Harry didn't either. He waited,
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-04.png	pulling on his gloves and adjusting his hat. 'Look, Bob,'
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-05.png	Harry began, after a brief silence, 'I don't mean to
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-06.png	butt in, but if you take my advice you'll 'ave no
data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-07.png	more truck with 'er.'
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-00.png	He jerked his thumb over his
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-01.png	shoulder. 'That girl's nothing but a load
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-02.png	of trouble, I'm warning you.' 'Kitty's
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-03.png	all right', Bone contradicted flatly. 'It's
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-04.png	her boy-friend that's the trouble. If
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-05.png	we could get rid of him...' Harry
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-06.png	nodded his grizzled head like an old
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-07.png	hound. 'You're right there, Bob', he
data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-08.png	muttered. 'But it's easier said than done.
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-00.png	Kitty encourages him, too. No work, no
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-01.png	background, no regular money so far as I
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-02.png	can make out. Probably on the crook.
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-03.png	But there you are, the girl's wild and
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-04.png	headstrong. I can't do nothing with 'er.'
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-05.png	'Don't worry, Harry', the other said quietly.
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-06.png	'I won't make a fool of myself.
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-07.png	Kitty needs a good friend and I'll
data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-08.png	always be that.'
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-00.png	He paused, hatred of Stevie Hewitt
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-01.png	rising like gall in his throat.
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-02.png	'And I'll find a way of getting rid of
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-03.png	that chap, Hewitt, too. Leave it to me.'
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-04.png	'O.K., Bob, but watch your step. He's
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-05.png	a tough customer, mark my words', Harry
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-06.png	said in a low voice. Bone half smiled
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-07.png	in the darkness. 'I'll remember', he said.
data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-08.png	'Good night, Harry.' 'Good night, Bob.'
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-00.png	Bone walked down the road, his cre*?
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-01.png	5pe-soled shoes making no sound
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-02.png	on the asphalt surface. As he walked
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-03.png	he concentrated on the problem of
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-04.png	Stevie Hewitt. By comparison with the
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-05.png	manner in which he had dispatched
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-06.png	Henry Mansell the elimination of a
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-07.png	little spiv from Brighton seemed an
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-08.png	easy undertaking... once he'd set
data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-09.png	his mind to it.
data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-00.png	Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided?
data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-01.png	Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-02.png	panel and pulled it out. The black tin box was exactly
data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-03.png	as he had left it. With heavily beating heart he reached
data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-04.png	out and lifted the lid. Everything was intact and he
data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-05.png	gasped with relief.
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-00.png	He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-01.png	to count them. Of course, he remembered being in a great hurry to get
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-02.png	that fifty pounds for Kitty! Obviously he had been careless in
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-03.png	replacing the panel, but the possibility of anyone having
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-04.png	discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock.
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-05.png	As he replaced the bundles of notes, he withdrew the tin
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-06.png	box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-07.png	cupboard.
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-00.png	It would be safer under lock and key
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-01.png	for the time being than behind a piece
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-02.png	of panelling which did not fit very sec-
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-03.png	urely. Tomorrow he would buy a
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-04.png	heavy padlock for the box and search
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-05.png	for a new hiding-place. He lay in bed,
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-06.png	cold and uneasy, unable to account
data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-07.png	for an instinctive sense of danger.
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-00.png	When he closed his eyes it was
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-01.png	Henry Mansell's face he saw, hovering
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-02.png	above his head like a hideous caricature. The
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-03.png	parrot nose and straight line of the mouth,
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-04.png	the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-05.png	him right down to his abjectly quaking
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-06.png	bones. The mouldering horror that had
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-07.png	once been Henry Mansell taunted him
data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-08.png	now in the silent darkness.
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-00.png	In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-01.png	Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-02.png	Dowell drank their beer and waited. 'It's too damn busy
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-03.png	in here. We can't expect him to leave his customers',
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-04.png	Hugh said morosely. 'Give him a chance, old chap.
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-05.png	He'll be over. Jim's a most reliable chap when
data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-06.png	it comes to picking up a small tip.'
data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-00.png	'O.K., Roddy, whatever you say.' Hugh drained his glass and
data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-01.png	ordered two more beers. 'I'm really beginning to feel it's
data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-02.png	all a bit of a waste of time, anyway. I've been collecting
data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-03.png	scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four
data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-04.png	months now, and the whole lot still doesn't amount to
data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-05.png	anything one could call concrete.'
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-00.png	Roddy puffed at his pipe, his eyes fixed on the white-coated
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-01.png	barman. 'Oh, I think it does, Hugh. That's
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-02.png	why I want you to meet this bird. I think
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-03.png	he fills in an important part of the
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-04.png	background. Furthermore, dear boy, it confirms
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-05.png	what we already know of your father's
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-06.png	intention to leave the country on the night
data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-07.png	of October 14th.'
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-00.png	Hugh nodded. His face wore the melancholy expression
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-01.png	that was habitual to him but his eyes showed
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-02.png	his inner excitement. 'I know, but from the
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-03.png	moment he walked out of here we haven't a
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-04.png	shred of evidence to prove what happened.
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-05.png	Obviously he met someone, either by chance or
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-06.png	by arrangement. Whichever way it was, that
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-07.png	person had a gun and he managed to persuade
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-08.png	Father to drive along that quiet stretch of
data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-09.png	road....'
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-00.png	'Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-01.png	Lydd', Roddy interposed quickly. 'And once there he was
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-02.png	shot at close range and his money smartly filched.
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-03.png	You know, whoever it was might have known of the
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-04.png	existence of the suicide letter... providing him with
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-05.png	an almost unshakable alibi.' Hugh was thinking of
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-06.png	his uncle, but said nothing. After all, Julian had
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-07.png	acted very strangely since the tragedy, always
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-08.png	secretive, always reluctant to discuss his brother's
data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-09.png	death.
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-00.png	It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-01.png	cold-blooded murder but, in fact, Henry Mansell's
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-02.png	death had saved the firm and Julian's future.
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-03.png	Moreover he might well have been aware of his
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-04.png	brother's intention to skip out of the country and
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-05.png	passed on the information. 'I'm sure you're right',
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-06.png	Hugh said thoughtfully. 'But whoever did it got
data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-07.png	clean away without being spotted.'
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-00.png	'Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter,
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-01.png	believe me', Roddy affirmed solemnly. 'He probably caught
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-02.png	the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-03.png	with the money somewhere.' Hugh nodded. 'I realized that
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-04.png	after my talk with Mrs. Lawford. There are a dozen countries
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-05.png	where a man could easily hide up and change the money
data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-06.png	without danger.
data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-00.png	Unless we can get a definite line on him it's
data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-01.png	hopeless....' 'Something will turn up one day, you'll see',
data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-02.png	Roddy said confidently. 'If we plug away at the leads
data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-03.png	we have....' 'If only the police would do something...' Hugh
data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-04.png	cried out in exasperation. 'I've put everything I know
data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-05.png	before them....'
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-00.png	'No dice, Hugh.' Roddy shook his sandy head.
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-01.png	'They're bound to want pretty solid new evidence
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-02.png	before they'll agree to reopen the case. From
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-03.png	their point of view the evidence for suicide is
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-04.png	overwhelming. I spoke to a chap from the office of
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-05.png	the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-06.png	well, and he agreed that the missing cash is
data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-07.png	a hell of a mystery.
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-00.png	But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-01.png	money could have been disposed of in London
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-02.png	before your father left that evening. It wouldn't be
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-03.png	unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-04.png	for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-05.png	as particular debts of honour before taking his own
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-06.png	life. Also, logically, there's nothing to show the
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-07.png	money couldn't have been pinched by someone
data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-08.png	passing the car after your father was dead.
data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-00.png	&quot;Why?&quot; he asked again. &quot;I can tell by your voice that it means
data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-01.png	a lot to you, but I'm damned if I can see the reason. It's not as
data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-02.png	if you were all that fond of Alice.&quot; He was interrupted by the
data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-03.png	arrival of the food and wine. When the pouring ritual was over he
data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-04.png	went on:
data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-00.png	If he didn't do it it must have been -&quot; &quot;Must have been
data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-01.png	who?&quot; Max prompted. I looked into his eyes and longed
data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-02.png	with all my heart to tell him, but I could not do it.
data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-03.png	As long as my suspicion remained in my head I could pretend
data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-04.png	to myself, in moments of optimism, that it was not true.
data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-00.png	If you're right, you may be in serious danger from Hardy.
data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-01.png	Even if you're wrong you'll most certainly be in danger when
data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-02.png	you start handling a boat.&quot; He picked up his glass and
data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-03.png	held it in both hands, looking at me thoughtfully over the
data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-04.png	top of it. &quot;No,&quot; he said at last. &quot;I can't allow # #
data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-05.png	it.&quot;
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-00.png	&quot;You can't very well stop me.&quot; &quot;I can
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-01.png	do better than that. If we were to
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-02.png	get married now I could come
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-03.png	with you.&quot; I looked down at my
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-04.png	plate, not daring to let him see
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-05.png	how much the idea appealed to
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-06.png	me, reminding myself that he could
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-07.png	only have said such a thing
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-08.png	because he did not know the
data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-09.png	whole truth.
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-00.png	&quot;And I can't allow that,&quot; I said.
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-01.png	&quot;Deadlock,&quot; said Max. &quot;No, it isn't.
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-02.png	I'm determined to go, and by myself,
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-03.png	whatever you say.&quot; &quot;I was afraid of
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-04.png	that.&quot; He sounded resigned but none
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-05.png	the less hopeful. &quot;You're a very
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-06.png	wilful woman but I'll change
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-07.png	your mind for you one of these
data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-08.png	days.
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-00.png	"You can see it any time you like,"
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-01.png	he told me. "The sooner the better.
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-02.png	If you can get to Bletcham this
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-03.png	evening I'll run you up there
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-04.png	in the car." "That's very nice of
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-05.png	you." "Nice, nothing. I told you,
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-06.png	I'm mad about boats. Seven
data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-07.png	thirty do you?
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-00.png	I could meet you at the bus station.&quot;
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-01.png	&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;outside your office.&quot;
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-02.png	I could not endure the thought
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-03.png	of another wait at the bus station.
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-04.png	He was there punctually. Dressed
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-05.png	in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-06.png	shorts he looked hardly more than
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-07.png	a boy, a cheerful, good-natured
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-08.png	boy. He settled me into the car
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-09.png	with touching care and then
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-10.png	drove like a fiend along
data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-11.png	the river road.
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-00.png	Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-01.png	and helped me out with the same
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-02.png	careful courtesy. &quot;What sort of boat is it?&quot;
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-03.png	I asked. &quot;She,&quot; he corrected. &quot;She's a
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-04.png	converted life-boat. Not a very good one,
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-05.png	but she's sound enough and the
data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-06.png	engine's fine.&quot;
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-00.png	Inside, she was untidy and grubby but
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-01.png	roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-02.png	good-sized windows. It was a long time
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-03.png	before I got used to calling them
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-04.png	portholes. The owner was a middle-aged
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-05.png	man whose family had tired of the
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-06.png	limited excitement of the river and now
data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-07.png	had their eyes on a seagoing boat.
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-00.png	Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-01.png	haggled with him and within half an hour
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-02.png	Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-03.png	fifty pounds. When all the business details
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-04.png	had been settled and the owner had
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-05.png	departed with my cheque in his pocket,
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-06.png	Clive started the engine and gave me my
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-07.png	first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-08.png	the river and in and out of the other boats.
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-00.png	It was a warm, still evening; the plop of
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-01.png	fish and the gentle putter of the engine
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-02.png	were infinitely soothing after city noises,
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-03.png	and I began to look forward to my life
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-04.png	on the water. At last he pronounced
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-05.png	me riverworthy and wanted to know when
data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-06.png	I would be moving in.
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-00.png	A shudder, more mental than physical, ran
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-01.png	through him, and his mind seemed to
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-02.png	melt away into emptiness. His bulging
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-03.png	eyes caught the reclining form of Heather,
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-04.png	who was still repeating in sing-song:
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-05.png	&quot;. . . I will not give in. . .&quot; He stared at her
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-06.png	blankly, mouthing an incoherent gabble
data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-07.png	of half words.
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-00.png	He slapped himself in the face and
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-01.png	cuffed the sides of his head. Then
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-02.png	by degrees the rotating objects
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-03.png	slowed, and coming into focus took
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-04.png	the form of the furnishings in Dan
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-05.png	Brown's living room. He stood up un-
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-06.png	steadily and looked about the room,
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-07.png	trying to gather his wits. Outside the
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-08.png	dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-09.png	the heights beyond were in
data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-10.png	silhouette, already a solid black.
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-00.png	He bumped into a floor lamp and
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-01.png	switched it on. Heather McNabb still lay
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-02.png	on the couch, her body uncomfortably twisted
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-03.png	and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks.
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-04.png	He went to the kitchen for water and found
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-05.png	Dan. Dan was lying on a long bench in the
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-06.png	breakfast nook, his head bent upright
data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-07.png	against the wall.
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-00.png	Then something like a zest for living began to come back
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-01.png	to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-02.png	enough animation to produce a wan smile. Dan's low mut-
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-03.png	tering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-04.png	could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-05.png	she was growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-06.png	Dan, or rather the physical relic of him - the empty
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-07.png	shell of flesh and bone, devoid of intellect and
data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-08.png	personality.
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-00.png	And these had been his great qualities,
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-01.png	so attractive to her. The Base Station had
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-02.png	gone before, discharging its narrow plane of
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-03.png	4ementalating energy along the length of
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-04.png	the Earth's imaginary longitudes, moving
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-05.png	eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-06.png	reversed progression. It had brought the
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-07.png	First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest,
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-08.png	the empty-minded receptiveness that
data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-09.png	prepared the way for the Second Stage.
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-00.png	&quot;They have come!&quot; he said reverently, gripping his
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-01.png	hands together between his knees and leaning
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-02.png	forward. &quot;Isn't it a glorious thing! Long awaited
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-03.png	transcendent event, the exalted desire of all
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-04.png	mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-05.png	Mind is at hand!&quot; He turned beaming eyes
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-06.png	upward and shook his head slowly from
data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-07.png	side to side.
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-00.png	A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-01.png	abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-02.png	at an intersection for the light to change. At his
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-03.png	apartment he garaged his car and then stood
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-04.png	listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-05.png	earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart
data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-06.png	loses its beat in death.
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-00.png	Deadly stillness, deadly portent!
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-01.png	Steve awakened early and switched on
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-02.png	the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO.
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-03.png	The set lighted-up but gave only a low
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-04.png	buzzing sound. He had just finished
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-05.png	shaving when it came on, with a flat
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-06.png	voice repeating: &quot;This is BBC calling
data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-07.png	. . . this is BBC calling. . .&quot;
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-00.png	After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-01.png	went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-02.png	in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-03.png	went dead again, and Steve had no stomach for
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-04.png	breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-05.png	should be. Steve got out the car and traversed the
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-06.png	same empty streets as he had the night before,
data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-07.png	to keep an appointment with Heather.
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-00.png	Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-01.png	Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-02.png	flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-03.png	the War Memorial. There was a deep
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-04.png	whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-05.png	overtone that sang in his ears with an
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-06.png	almost painful sharpness. He reversed and
data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-07.png	turned back on McKenzie Avenue.
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-00.png	There can be little doubt that if the
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-01.png	Thetans discover our mental independence
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-02.png	they will promptly give us their hypnotic
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-03.png	treatment. If we can avoid undue
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-04.png	prominence, it may be that we can
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-05.png	move about pretty freely without
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-06.png	detection. If we can - well, then we
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-07.png	may be able to promote our own
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-08.png	interests. What those interests
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-09.png	are, beyond personal security,
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-10.png	I haven't a clue; but, who knows,
data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-11.png	we may form the nucleus around ...
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-00.png	When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-01.png	gave the impression of having been thought out and
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-02.png	decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-03.png	Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-04.png	of their presence. They just stared at him, turning
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-05.png	their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-06.png	down, up and down.
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-00.png	So they proceeded to see if the coast
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-01.png	was clear. The street was quiet and
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-02.png	deserted, and there were neither sight
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-03.png	nor sound of flying saucers. So they
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-04.png	ventured forth and made their way on
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-05.png	foot to Dan's house. Dan came
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-06.png	to the door at their ring but neglected
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-07.png	to offer any greeting. He was deeply
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-08.png	preoccupied, and it seemed that the
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-09.png	ringing of a doorbell was to him
data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-10.png	a new and strange phenomenon.
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-00.png	His whole attitude was a mixture of
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-01.png	impatience pending an awaited
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-02.png	communication and of a vague
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-03.png	perplexity respecting his surroundings
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-04.png	and the purpose he was to serve.
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-05.png	Finally, being so obviously on their own,
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-06.png	Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-07.png	at home. Steve switched on Dan's
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-08.png	powerful, world-wide radio and systematically
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-09.png	turned the tuning knob through all the
data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-10.png	tuning points of the world's great radio
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-00.png	After a long wait a bus appeared and they
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-01.png	followed the beaming Dan aboard, taking
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-02.png	seats some rows behind him. Steve was
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-03.png	beginning to find the stereotyped, flattish, happy
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-04.png	faces very disconcerting; and looking at
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-05.png	Heather he found a welcome relief in her
data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-06.png	relatively long doleful one
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-00.png	Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-01.png	real days and would return to New York in late
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-02.png	January or early February. Angelina might be a
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-03.png	little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-04.png	as arranged, but he consoled himself by
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-05.png	thinking that he and Angelina would have
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-06.png	plenty of time together in the future. And
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-07.png	Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-08.png	back on Moon again, and able to do
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-09.png	research at first hand into matters on which
data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-10.png	the future of everyone, including Angelina, depended...
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-00.png	The recovery of his balance was due to the
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-01.png	fact that he was living, virtually without
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-02.png	expenses, with the people to whom Moke had
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-03.png	sent him: little people who regarded him as
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-04.png	lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes.
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-05.png	Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat
data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-06.png	(Stamp Department) while Sally sulked at home.
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-00.png	Sometimes she took Harry around with her, but
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-01.png	never her husband, a fact he accepted as inevitable. &quot;I guess
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-02.png	Sally made a mistake about me,&quot; he said one
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-03.png	evening, when he had been left to cook his own meal.
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-04.png	All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now, but Tom
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-05.png	was a Static Mib, the middle-income-bracket equivalent
data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-06.png	to 4sub-lil on the lower.
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-00.png	One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-01.png	with time instil the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires,
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-02.png	especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-03.png	Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-04.png	solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-05.png	used in the last few wars, but it seemed very probable
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-06.png	that they would be in the next one, Moon and her
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-07.png	allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-08.png	weapons pronounced conventional.
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-00.png	Lester was not home yet from his formidable
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-01.png	duties and his wife, in the manner of middle-brow
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-02.png	wives, romanced about him in his absence. &quot;Lester was a
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-03.png	country lawyer, and we were very small 4microdebs, weren't we,
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-04.png	Sally&quot; - here she had dropped her voice in homage to the
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-05.png	economic system: that was reverenced - &quot;when he thought
data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-06.png	we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics.
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-00.png	Know how he did it? He's clever on
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-01.png	the mouth-organ. So when he visited some
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-02.png	craterlet on Face (ours is an agricultural
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-03.png	Back-Face area) the cry would go up,
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-04.png	as soon as he had spoken a few
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-05.png	sentences of his speech: 'Cut the
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-06.png	politics, Lester, give us something on
data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-07.png	your mouth-organ.'
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-00.png	But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-01.png	or B in the finals next May, and since mating
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-02.png	prospects would depend upon salaries, scholarship for
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-03.png	these fine young people was closely geared to
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-04.png	economic and biological ends which, essentially,
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-05.png	were really means. So, seeing them revolve in
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-06.png	circles, Harry had the feeling that Moke (or what
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-07.png	Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised, any-
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-08.png	way in Harry's mind) had these splendid young
data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-09.png	people by the short hairs, and was diverting them ...
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-00.png	Peron entered, a large man, who had once been
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-01.png	handsome but was now seedy-looking, a sufferer
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-02.png	from stomach-ulcers. In the Back-Face tradition he
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-03.png	wore, and kept on indoors, a fifty gallon hat. Harry was
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-04.png	prepared for something unpleasant, for this was
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-05.png	the Senator who had annoyed the United States
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-06.png	by bragging how he had once won a trick from
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-07.png	W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-08.png	rockets (an admission which would scarcely help
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-09.png	bluff to succeed the next time) and, lately, by
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-10.png	saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid
data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-11.png	of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region,
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-00.png	But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-01.png	Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer, to have the same adolescent
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-02.png	openness and freshness, though perhaps not the same
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-03.png	maturity. One remembered that he was a lawyer
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-04.png	by training, and suspected that the points he made
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-05.png	so sharply in international politics were as abstract
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-06.png	to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-07.png	of law.
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-00.png	The motive would be the same in both cases, to
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-01.png	serve this home of his, in which his heart lay.
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-02.png	Here the rocket man's charm was disarming. Yet
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-03.png	when the time came to leave, Harry felt as de-
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-04.png	pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office,
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-05.png	exactly a month ago. If even Mo statesmen only
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-06.png	did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-

data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-08.png	and their lunar and earthly repercussions, to luck
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-09.png	(or to Moke), there was a vacuum where there should
data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-10.png	be a centre of trust, responsible for the maintenance
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-00.png	The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-01.png	like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-02.png	guise which, far from attracting the allegiance
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-03.png	of free men everywhere, could only repel them.
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-04.png	Then what of the cultural life? Did this per-
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-05.png	haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-06.png	which might in time become social fact
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-07.png	and counteract the obsession with economics
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-08.png	which had grown up during the Moon's
data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-09.png	first two centuries?
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-00.png	Stepping out in their white shorts, they looked glad enough
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-01.png	to be diverted, however, with the single exception of one
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-02.png	worried little man-student who kept getting out of
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-03.png	step. He looked as if nothing Moke and his
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-04.png	minions could do to him would ever make him
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-05.png	GO; but the reason probably lay in elementary
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-06.png	neurosis and not in some eruption from those
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-07.png	deeper layers in the human psyche which are
data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-08.png	trans-economic.
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-00.png	'Impressive,' Lord Undertone said, gazing reverently
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-01.png	on the cosmic handiwork. 'All those stars. But I'm
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-02.png	a bit earthbound tonight, Trout. I've got a queer
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-03.png	feeling, like I always get when something
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-04.png	sensational's going to happen. There's things lurking
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-05.png	if you ask me. Might be jaguar, might be...
data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-06.png	head-shrinkers.
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-00.png	'Bottle-Foot, my lord.' 'Bottle-Foot?' His lordship
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-01.png	may have thought I had become unbalanced
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-02.png	through fear. 'A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-03.png	to other day, my lord. A being of whom
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-04.png	the forest Indians are said to be mortally
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-05.png	afraid, with a hoof shaped like the heel
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-06.png	of a bottle. If your lordship will excuse me
data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-07.png	a moment...'
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-00.png	Small, repulsive creatures they were,
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-01.png	with black, matted hair and a striking
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-02.png	resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-03.png	gazed at recently; and I have no
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-04.png	hesitation in saying that they would have
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-05.png	made an end of us but for an intervention
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-06.png	so unexpected, so unusual, that only the
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-07.png	necessity of rounding my narrative
data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-08.png	compels me to mention it.
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-00.png	Sally and of course Mrs Septimus, for surely
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-01.png	Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-02.png	myself? But was it so? I allowed myself
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-03.png	to entertain for an instant the idea, the
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-04.png	strange, the unwelcome, the almost
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-05.png	inconceivable idea, that Ariadne's arrival
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-06.png	would be inopportune; and with the idea came
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-07.png	a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused,
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-08.png	to watch Mr Septimus more closely, Mrs
data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-09.png	Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-00.png	But all three were to the casual
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-01.png	observation I permitted myself unruffled;
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-02.png	Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-03.png	thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-04.png	we were all invaded by a most tranquil
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-05.png	mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing,
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-06.png	so Mr Gilberto told us, that the wild and
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-07.png	savage tribes never approached this region: at
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-08.png	any rate they remained with us, perhaps
data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-09.png	for such protection as our presence, or Mrs
data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-00.png	But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-01.png	far from our minds that at any moment we were
data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-02.png	to receive a summons. I could see that Mr Septimus
data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-03.png	was impatient for it. This afternoon, then, we climbed
data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-04.png	a promontory, a mass of clean rock crowned with
data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-05.png	trees and bushes, that stood well out over the lake.
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-00.png	NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-01.png	single-decker Welsh bus could have got
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-02.png	itself into orbit. Shooting up over the pass a bit
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-03.png	too carefree, and becoming airborne?
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-04.png	Caught by a sudden gust of wind? A
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-05.png	combination of the two? No one seems
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-06.png	to know. But the fact remains that get
data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-07.png	itself into orbit it did.
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-00.png	And a fine old fuss there was about it, too.
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-01.png	Here are the known facts. On 10th July,
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-02.png	the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl,
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-03.png	left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual.
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-04.png	Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-05.png	Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader;
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-06.png	pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-07.png	and Miss Ethel Yates, hikers from
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-08.png	Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the
data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-09.png	Rev. Edwards.
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-00.png	Yes, the bus set out from Dinas. So much
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-01.png	is established. Ifor Huw Evans, Propr.,
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-02.png	watched it go from the windows of the
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-03.png	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested,
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-04.png	Ifor was. For there was his garage hand,
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-05.png	Dai Pugh, taking a tearful farewell of
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-06.png	Morfydd Owen. Morfydd, who had until
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-07.png	recently been Ifor's typist, but was now
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-08.png	returning to her home town as a
data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-09.png	fully-fledged schoolteacher.
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-00.png	&quot;But I'm only going fifteen miles away,&quot;
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-01.png	Morfydd was saying. &quot;Not the end of
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-02.png	the world, is it?&quot; &quot;For me it is,&quot; Dai
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-03.png	said wretchedly, wiping his hands on his
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-04.png	overalls preparatory to a last embrace. &quot;You
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-05.png	will not be remembering a mere garage
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-06.png	hand when you are lording it over
data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-07.png	the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl.&quot;
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-00.png	&quot;Silly boy,&quot; said Morfydd. Though she
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-01.png	could not help wondering whether, now she
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-02.png	had qualified as a schoolteacher, poor
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-03.png	little Dai was quite the man for her.
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-04.png	A nice boy of course. But perhaps in the
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-05.png	new world she was entering there might
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-06.png	be boys equally nice, and with far more
data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-07.png	to offer. The conductor rang his bell.
data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-00.png	"Good-bye, Dai," said Morfydd, smiling from the bottom step.
data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-01.png	"Good-bye, Morfydd." He sought to enfold her in his arms. But he was too late.
data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-02.png	She was already up the bus steps, and the bus was away. And Morfydd Owen
data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-03.png	waving, unkissed, from the window. And Dai, on the pavement, knowing in his
data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-04.png	heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas.
data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-00.png	So the bus set out for Llangrwl. But it never reached there! Somewhere,
data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-01.png	on those fifteen miles of mountain roads, it disappeared from the earthly
data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-02.png	scene. The first intimation that all was not well came when a
data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-03.png	Mr. Isaiah Roberts, landlord of The Traveller's Joy, rang up the
data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-04.png	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-05.png	damn bus.
data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-00.png	"Left here all right," said Ifor. "Two-thirty-five, on the dot." "It's
data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-01.png	supposed to leave at two-twenty." "Who says so?" "Your timetable."
data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-02.png	"Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables," Ifor said,
data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-03.png	reasonably. "Start running punctual and where are you? People get
data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-04.png	left behind, isn't it? Very exasperating for one and all."
data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-00.png	&quot;And what are you going to do about it?&quot; Tendentious, Mr. Roberts sounded.
data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-01.png	&quot;What do you want me to do? Send out a sheriff's posse, is it?&quot; No sense
data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-02.png	of humour, that Isaiah. He banged down the receiver. Very uncivil. Dropped
data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-03.png	the mask, now, Ifor did. &quot;Dai Pugh,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;Leap on your bicycle
data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-04.png	and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy.
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-00.png	The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-01.png	complete her mission.&quot; Paled, did Dai. For the
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-02.png	two-twenty carried, for him, a cargo more
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-03.png	precious than jewels. Though Mofydd Owen
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-04.png	was, as he feared, departed out of his life,
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-05.png	he still loved her dearly. Already, even
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-06.png	as with trembling fingers he fastened his
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-07.png	trouser clips, he was seeing her lying in
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-08.png	some dreadful ravine, or beset by
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-09.png	robbers, or being whisked off to Emergency
data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-10.png	Ward 10.
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-00.png	But even his imagination, luckily for him,
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-01.png	did not visualise the awful truth - that
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-02.png	Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-03.png	the title of &quot;First Woman to Enter Space.&quot;
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-04.png	&quot;Where are we going, Mam?&quot; inquired little
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-05.png	Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-06.png	the fact that the green earth was falling
data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-07.png	away at a rate of knots.
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-00.png	Where indeed? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-01.png	to the conductor, demanding an explanation.
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-02.png	But nonplussed, the conductor was. A
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-03.png	good man, mind; knew his job. But out of
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-04.png	depth in this particular instance. Fingered
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-05.png	his ticket-punch nervously. Peered out of
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-06.png	the window. Went and consulted the driver.
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-07.png	"Where are we going?" he echoed Cadwallader.
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-08.png	"Damned if I know, boy," said the driver.
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-09.png	"But something very untoward has
data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-10.png	happened, if you ask me."
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-00.png	Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser, was the
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-01.png	Rev. Edwards. Now he put down his paper,
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-02.png	folded it, and glanced idly out of the
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-03.png	window. Looked again, eyes starting from
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-04.png	his head. &quot;God bless my immortal soul,&quot;
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-05.png	he cried. &quot;Never mind your immortal
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-06.png	soul,&quot; said Megan Thomas tartly.
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-07.png	&quot;Here we are traversing the heavens at the
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-08.png	very moment when we should be
data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-09.png	running into Llangrwl bus station.
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-00.png	And no one doing the first thing about
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-01.png	it.&quot; Stung, the conductor was. &quot;What you
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-02.png	expect me to do?&quot; he inquired, bitter.
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-03.png	&quot;Radio Flying Control at London Airport,
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-04.png	is it?&quot; &quot;Mutual recriminations will get
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-05.png	us nowhere,&quot; boomed the Rev. Edwards.
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-06.png	&quot;It's all very well,&quot; commented
data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-07.png	Mr. Hayball from the back seat.
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-00.png	&quot;But Eth and me wanted to be
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-01.png	at the Youth Hostel before dark.&quot;
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-02.png	Morfydd Owen was silent. But she
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-03.png	looked down at the fast-disappearing
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-04.png	earth, and it seemed to her that she
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-05.png	would never see her Dai again. And
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-06.png	though half an hour ago she had
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-07.png	regarded this possibility with
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-08.png	fortitude, it now filled her with
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-09.png	dismay. Quietly she began to
data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-10.png	weep...
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-00.png	Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-01.png	furiously on the road. Not a sign of
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-02.png	the bus. He passed The Traveller's
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-03.png	Joy. At last he caught up Mr. Roberts,
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-04.png	walking very dogged towards Llangrwl.
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-05.png	&quot;Afternoon, Mr. Roberts,&quot; he called, polite,
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-06.png	as he shot past. His spirits were rising.
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-07.png	He had seen no sign of an accident.
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-08.png	Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken.
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-09.png	He would find the bus safe and sound in
data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-10.png	Llangrwl, and his dear Morfydd quietly
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-00.png	But disappointment awaited him. A
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-01.png	restive queue of people in the bus station,
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-02.png	waiting to be transported to Dinas. And
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-03.png	when he went to Morfydd's house, all
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-04.png	he found was Morfydd's mam, working
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-05.png	herself up proper... Getting dark, now.
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-06.png	The conductor switched on the lights.
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-07.png	The beleaguered passengers peered out of
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-08.png	the windows. Little to be seen, only a
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-09.png	few lone stars, and the distant earth
data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-10.png	brooding in her shroud of mist.
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-00.png	Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped, nursing
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-01.png	the sleeping Cadwallader. Driver and
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-02.png	conductor peered ahead into nothingness.
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-03.png	On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-04.png	his Eth. Morfydd thought of Dai. The
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-05.png	Rev. Edwards, standing at the front,
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-06.png	looked at his forlorn flock. "What
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-07.png	about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda?"
data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-08.png	he suggested hopefully.
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-00.png	They looked at him, sullen. His heart
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-01.png	sank. If the Welsh found the situation
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-02.png	too desperate for singing, then the
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-03.png	situation, he realised, must be desperate
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-04.png	indeed. But suddenly they were roused
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-05.png	from their lethargy. Something was
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-06.png	approaching, faster, faster, a tearing
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-07.png	hurrying blur that was past and gone
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-08.png	in a moment, followed by a great
data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-09.png	rush of sound. They waved frantically.
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-00.png	He saluted, and left the presence, very crestfallen...
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-01.png	Time passed. The bus climbed, and went quietly
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-02.png	into orbit. Time passed. The Rev. Edwards' pulpit
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-03.png	remained empty. And so did the arms of Dai
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-04.png	Pugh. How could they be otherwise, when his
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-05.png	beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a-
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-06.png	quarter-hour intervals, regular as clockwork?
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-07.png	Time passed. Everyone said, &quot;Pity about Megan
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-08.png	Thomas, isn't it,&quot; as though they didn't really think
data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-09.png	it was a pity at all; as, indeed, they didn't.
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-00.png	LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-01.png	Dinas Advertiser. But the London papers ignored
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-02.png	the whole affair. Ifor Evans reported his loss
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-03.png	to the police. But they only tut-tutted. &quot;Lost
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-04.png	a bus, is it. Very careless.&quot; That was their
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-05.png	attitude. Now if there'd been a good old accident,
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-06.png	they could have measured up the road and
data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-07.png	taken an interest.
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-00.png	But losing a bus! People were always losing
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-01.png	things. You'd be surprised, they said. So it
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-02.png	seemed, for a time, that the whole affair would
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-03.png	be written off as one of those unexplained
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-04.png	mysteries, like the Marie Celeste. Then things
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-05.png	began to happen... But what about the voyagers?
data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-06.png	you will be asking.
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-00.png	Well, the Rev. Edwards had taken command. "Our
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-01.png	position," he said, "is somewhat analogous to
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-02.png	that of a castaway on a desert island. Now
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-03.png	what does such a person do? He signals
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-04.png	his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-05.png	flag on a palm tree. And he tries to ensure
data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-06.png	a supply of food."
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-00.png	&quot;Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus,&quot;
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-01.png	the conductor said firmly. &quot;Contrary to the
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-02.png	Company's Regulations.&quot; &quot;Of course not,&quot; agreed
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-03.png	the minister. &quot;No, we have another way of signalling
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-04.png	our position. The driver must sound his horn
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-05.png	continuously.&quot; Gave him a look, the driver did.
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-06.png	&quot;Where you think we are?&quot; he asked rudely.
data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-07.png	&quot;Dinas High Street?&quot;
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-00.png	&quot;Do as I say, driver.&quot; Very stern, the reverend
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-01.png	gentleman was. So the driver peep-peeped as
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-02.png	through empty space. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the Rev.
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-03.png	Edwards said courteously. &quot;Secondly, we must
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-04.png	pool and ration our supplies of food, if any.&quot;
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-05.png	He looked at Price the Provisions, who was nursing
data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-06.png	a great basket.
data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-00.png	&quot;Now, who has any food?&quot; he asked hopefully.
data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-01.png	Stared back did Price the Provisions, unwinking.
data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-02.png	&quot;Mr. Price, I think you may be able to help us here,&quot;
data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-03.png	said the Rev. Edwards. Price shook his head.
data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-04.png	&quot;Intended for Plas Newydd, this lot is. Paid for,
data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-05.png	too.&quot; He folded his arms protectively over the basket.
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-00.png	Mutinous dog, thought the Rev. Edwards, who hadn't
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-01.png	enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-02.png	Island. &quot;What have you got in that basket, Price?&quot;
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-03.png	he roared. Quelled, Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-04.png	list, pushed his glasses up on his nose, and
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-05.png	began to read. &quot;Six loaves, four pounds butter,
data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-06.png	two pounds marge, one tin pineapple, one York ham.&quot;
data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-00.png	Bertram's face was grim. &quot;You think it was the Snort,
data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-01.png	don't you?&quot; John gave a short laugh. &quot;I did,&quot; he
data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-02.png	said; &quot;but I'd better stop thinking that now.
data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-03.png	Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one.&quot;
data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-04.png	&quot;So there you are, my dear.&quot; Peggy's eyes filled
data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-05.png	with tears. &quot;It's so unfair,&quot; she said.
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-00.png	&quot;That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-01.png	months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-02.png	dockyard and now that she's ready for sea he goes
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-03.png	sick. Just because he's an Honourable he can do
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-04.png	what he likes. Anyway, why pick on you to succeed
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-05.png	him?&quot; John didn't answer. There was no point
data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-06.png	in sharing his discomfort with Peggy.
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-00.png	'But we -' 'Stop your stupid talk, woman!' 'We are -'
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-01.png	'Be silent, woman, and listen,' Band Appa Bondi said.
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-02.png	'We know much,' repeated the Chief Captive. 'Some
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-03.png	things we will tell you. All who make the journey from
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-04.png	the Heavy World become changed. Some die. Most live
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-05.png	and grow wings. Between the worlds are many strong
data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-06.png	rays, not seen or felt, which change our bodies.
data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-00.png	When you come here, when you come to the True
data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-01.png	World, you become a true human. The grub of the
data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-02.png	tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So humans
data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-03.png	change.' 'I cannot know what he says,' Haris said
data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-04.png	stubbornly, throwing himself down. But Lily-yo and
data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-05.png	Flor were listening.
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-00.png	'To this True World, as you call it, we come to die,'
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-01.png	Lily-yo said, doubtingly. The Captive with the
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-02.png	fleshless jaw said, 'The grub of the tigerfly thinks
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-03.png	it dies when it changes into a tigerfly.' 'You are still
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-04.png	young,' said the Chief Captive. 'You begin newly here.
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-05.png	Where are your souls?' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-06.png	each other. In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-07.png	heedlessly thrown down their souls.
data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-00.png	Haris had trampled on his. It was unthinkable!
data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-01.png	'You see. You needed them no more. You are still
data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-02.png	young. You may be able to have babies. Some of those
data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-03.png	babies may be born with wings.' The Captive with
data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-04.png	the boneless arms added, 'Some may be born wrong,
data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-05.png	as we are. Some may be born right.'
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-00.png	'You are too foul to live!' Haris growled. 'Why are
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-01.png	you not killed?' 'Because we know all things,' the
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-02.png	Chief Captive said. Suddenly his second head roused
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-03.png	itself and declared, 'To be a good shape is not all
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-04.png	in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot move
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-05.png	well we can - think. This tribe of the True World
data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-06.png	is good and knows these things.
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-00.png	So it lets us rule it.' Flor and Lily-yo
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-01.png	muttered together. 'Do you say that you poor
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-02.png	Captives rule the True World?' Lily-yo asked
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-03.png	at last. 'We do.' 'Then why are you captives?'
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-04.png	The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected,
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-05.png	making his perpetual little gesture of protest,
data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-06.png	spoke for the first time.
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-00.png	'To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-01.png	are slaves to it. Only an outcast is free. Because
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-02.png	we are Captives, we have the time to talk and
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-03.png	think and plan and know. Those who know
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-04.png	command the knives of others.' 'No hurt will
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-05.png	come to you, Lily-yo,' Band Appa Bondi added.
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-06.png	'You will live among us and enjoy your life free
data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-07.png	from harm.'
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-00.png	'No!' the Chief Captive said with both mouths.
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-01.png	'Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-02.png	Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-03.png	must help our great plan.' 'The invasion?' Bondi
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-04.png	asked. 'What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-05.png	here at a good time. Memories of the Heavy World
data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-06.png	and its savage life are still fresh in you.
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-00.png	We need such memories. So we ask you to go
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-01.png	back there on a great plan we have.' 'Go back?'
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-02.png	gasped Flor. 'Yes. We plan to attack the Heavy
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-03.png	World. You must help to lead our force.' The long
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-04.png	afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-05.png	of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-06.png	everlasting night.
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-00.png	Motion there was, but motion without event - except
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-01.png	for those negligible events that seemed so large to
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-02.png	the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-03.png	and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-04.png	that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-05.png	with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-06.png	new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-07.png	light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-08.png	flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-09.png	had no place here.
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-00.png	Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-01.png	been inclined to regard women as something
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-02.png	which must necessarily be subordinated to his
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-03.png	career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-04.png	his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-05.png	whom he had never met and on whom after no more
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-06.png	than a couple of telephone calls he was
data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-07.png	prepared to place complete reliance.
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-00.png	&quot;Good luck, Air Marshal,&quot; she said gently. &quot;I'll
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-01.png	be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-02.png	evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-03.png	both at midnight.&quot; They might have been
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-04.png	arranging a supper party. Then she rang off.
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-05.png	Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-06.png	uneventful life had he come across a girl who
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-07.png	sounded so charming and appeared to be so
data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-08.png	efficient.
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-00.png	It was a novel experience. Alastair was
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-01.png	quite unable to explain why he should feel
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-02.png	so much confidence in her. Once again
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-03.png	she checked back her instructions. It was
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-04.png	obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-05.png	faith which he was placing in her and
data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-06.png	was prepared to accept the responsibility.
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-00.png	For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-01.png	to switch on the lights; there was no colour -
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-02.png	physical features were distinguishable solely by
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-03.png	gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-04.png	capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-05.png	below, was not recognisable among the host
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-06.png	of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-07.png	radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-08.png	flickered across its surface, but there was
data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-09.png	no permanent image.
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-00.png	In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-01.png	make a direct comparison between the radar
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-02.png	image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-03.png	Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-04.png	left, Milan. The directional angle of the
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-05.png	scanner could be adjusted to cover any
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-06.png	particular area within its range. Geoffrey
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-07.png	turned the scale slowly to cover the
data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-08.png	ground immediately ahead.
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-00.png	Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-01.png	pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-02.png	dipped slightly. The needle of the speed
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-03.png	recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-04.png	before coming to rest at 5.0. "We're a bit
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-05.png	ahead of time," said Alastair. "We'll run
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-06.png	in on minimum engine power." Geoffrey
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-07.png	smiled. Alastair talked of running in when
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-08.png	they were still more than four hundred
data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-09.png	miles from their destination.
data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-00.png	He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the
data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-01.png	naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even
data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-02.png	on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-03.png	at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-04.png	the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-05.png	was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-00.png	Geoffrey set himself to consider the
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-01.png	movements of the Bentley. It had passed
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-02.png	him at the temporary bridge over the
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-03.png	Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-04.png	previous night. He worked out the distance
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-05.png	on the presumption that its route had been
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-06.png	through Florence and Rome and then
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-07.png	across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-08.png	It came to just over six hundred
data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-09.png	miles.
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-00.png	DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-01.png	time they docked at Belleray. And though Guy,
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-02.png	made nervous by Beryl's silence, drove at reckless
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-03.png	speed to the Villa, it was quickly evident that
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-04.png	the party was over. Piers came strolling out to
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-05.png	meet the Deanes, and as soon as Guy had
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-06.png	driven away, invited them casually to come to
data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-07.png	his flat for a drink.
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-00.png	&quot;Oh, she was due!&quot; And then he added in the same
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-01.png	casual tone, &quot;She's not returning to her family. She's
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-02.png	going to live with friends of the bank manager, just
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-03.png	this side of Belleray.&quot; Mrs. Deane made a suitable
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-04.png	comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-05.png	to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-06.png	unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-07.png	with anger against her she had no doubt.
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-00.png	To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-01.png	vengeance. She had expected to be met with violent
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-02.png	reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling.
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-03.png	But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-04.png	was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-05.png	He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-06.png	own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-07.png	asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-08.png	to come over and make the presentation in her stead.
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-00.png	&quot;I caught him just as he was going to the
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-01.png	airport to meet Blanche,&quot; he said. &quot;As a matter
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-02.png	of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-03.png	for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-04.png	too. They're both here.&quot; &quot;I didn't know she was
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-05.png	coming back from Barbados so soon.&quot; Beryl
data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-06.png	said the first thing that came into her head.
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-00.png	Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-01.png	express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-02.png	of his guests. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-03.png	suggested having a second party, the following week, he
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-04.png	poured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared,
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-05.png	had had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-06.png	nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-07.png	Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-08.png	earned gratuity to his native village at the
data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-09.png	north of the island.
data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-00.png	"It's your superior attitude that riles me." Beryl was
data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-01.png	scarlet with annoyance. "How I happened to be marooned
data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-02.png	at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree. You
data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-03.png	look as though it was only what you expected of me,
data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-04.png	as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-05.png	and his pals down."
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-00.png	It was all over and done with.
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-01.png	For the time being Beryl was content to let
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-02.png	it go at that, but she resolved to have
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-03.png	it out with Piers when a reasonable
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-04.png	opportunity presented itself. He must
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-05.png	learn that he could not treat her
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-06.png	with injustice and contempt, ignoring
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-07.png	her explanations as though he were
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-08.png	a schoolmaster and she a small,
data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-09.png	ignorant child.
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-00.png	He gave her no chance of any private
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-01.png	conversation that evening, for when
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-02.png	Blanche and Jack left, he went with
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-03.png	them. But next morning she insisted
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-04.png	on his taking her out in the jeep -
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-05.png	to find, if possible, Hubert and his
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-06.png	relations, and tell them of
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-07.png	her great disappointment at being
data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-08.png	held up in Balicou.
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-00.png	With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-01.png	Boxer, to the back, and made room for her
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-02.png	beside him. &quot;Is that all you want to do?&quot;
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-03.png	he asked, letting in the clutch. &quot;No; I want
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-04.png	to make you understand just what happened
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-05.png	about this Balicou trip,&quot; she returned
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-06.png	coldly. &quot;I'm a little tired of being treated
data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-07.png	like an ineffective imbecile.&quot;
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-00.png	&quot;And I'm heartily sick of being constantly called
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-01.png	to account for my manners,&quot; he retorted.
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-02.png	&quot;What have I done wrong now? I cover up for
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-03.png	you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-04.png	to make the presentation, I run the damned
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-05.png	party to the best of my ability - saying the
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-06.png	sugary things you ought to have been there
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-07.png	to say - and all you can do is to find
data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-08.png	fault.&quot;
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-00.png	You made some sort of a protest to Graybury.
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-01.png	I'll give you credit for that. But you didn't press
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-02.png	the matter because, very naturally, you were
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-03.png	thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-04.png	idyllic surroundings.&quot; &quot;How dare you say
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-05.png	such a thing?&quot; she blazed. &quot;For goodness'
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-06.png	sake show a glimmer of reason,&quot; was his
data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-07.png	equally indignant rejoinder.
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-00.png	&quot;You talk as though we were alone on Balicou!&quot;
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-01.png	She avoided his gaze, and tried to ignore that
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-02.png	last impertinent remark. &quot;With four other people -&quot;
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-03.png	&quot;Whom you never once managed to circumvent.&quot;
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-04.png	The mockery in his voice had deepened. &quot;With
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-05.png	all due deference, Miss Deane - come off it!&quot;
data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-06.png	She met his eyes then.
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-00.png	She wavered, and at last said
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-01.png	slowly, &quot;If you must drag the truth
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-02.png	out of me, I must ask you to regard
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-03.png	it as confidential.&quot; &quot;My dear Beryl,
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-04.png	don't tell me anything, if you'd rather
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-05.png	not.&quot; He was clearly startled by her
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-06.png	words. &quot;But remember, it was you,
data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-07.png	not I, who started this conversation.&quot;
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-00.png	&quot;Neither can Nigel,&quot; smiled Diana.
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-01.png	&quot;He's saving up to get married. Remember?&quot;
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-02.png	&quot;I remember,&quot; quipped the houseman,
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-03.png	meaning no offence, &quot;but does he?
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-04.png	That blonde was something.&quot; &quot;Anybody
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-05.png	I know?&quot; she smiled. &quot;I think so.
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-06.png	I got a good look at her. But if Nigel
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-07.png	wasn't there it isn't important, is it?&quot;
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-08.png	&quot;No,&quot; Di said immediately. &quot;It isn't at
data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-09.png	all important.&quot;
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-00.png	&quot;Oh, he wasn't. His motor-bike had
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-01.png	broken down outside and he noticed
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-02.png	your car and then you dancing with
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-03.png	this blonde.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; Nigel cocked
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-04.png	one eyebrow. &quot;Actually she was brunette
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-05.png	at the roots and I had a redhead on
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-06.png	the other arm. He would have told
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-07.png	you this, too?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she laughed.
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-08.png	&quot;He didn't actually see you. Because
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-09.png	it was your car I suppose he
data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-10.png	presumed it was you, all dressed up in
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-00.png	&quot;My white or my black?&quot; Nigel enquired.
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-01.png	&quot;Now I wonder which I wore at that
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-02.png	particular surgery?&quot; &quot;You are a fool,
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-03.png	darling,&quot; Di said happily. &quot;I shall take
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-04.png	great pleasure in telling that young man
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-05.png	exactly what you were doing that
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-06.png	evening.&quot; &quot;No, don't,&quot; he said, after
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-07.png	kissing her again. &quot;I rather like to have
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-08.png	the housemen think of me as a
data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-09.png	two-timing Don Juan.
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-00.png	I'm such a dull fellow, really.&quot; &quot;Dull?&quot; She
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-01.png	couldn't believe it. Self-deprecation
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-02.png	was not one of Nigel's usual attributes.
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-03.png	&quot;You need your holiday, darling. I only
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-04.png	wish I could go with you!&quot; &quot;Doctor
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-05.png	Wills, if you're making improper suggestions ...?&quot;
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-06.png	&quot;It would make me more interesting,
data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-07.png	I suppose?&quot; she enquired archly.
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-00.png	"No, it wouldn't!" he almost snapped,
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-01.png	surprising her. "You sounded like some-
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-02.png	body else for a moment there. It doesn't

data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-04.png	"Nigel - !" she gasped. "I didn't mean to
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-05.png	behave like anything of the kind. I
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-06.png	was only joking." "Well, don't. It's
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-07.png	miserable enough my having to take my
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-08.png	leave in the autumn without you
data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-09.png	trying to be bright and gay about it.
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-00.png	And then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-01.png	beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-02.png	toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin, told her
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-03.png	in halting 6patois that &quot;3Mistah Piers&quot; had
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-04.png	explained right at the start that &quot;3Mis' Beryl&quot;
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-05.png	would be 3&quot;plenty, plenty sad&quot; not to be back
data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-06.png	at the Villa in time.
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-00.png	That it wouldn't be her fault at all. That
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-01.png	she was a lady who, like her Uncle Charles,
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-02.png	took the highest pride in keeping her word. &quot;I
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-03.png	could see 3anudder 3t'ing,&quot; he went on in a
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-04.png	lower voice, his sunken black eyes twinkling.
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-05.png	3&quot;He powerful anxious, poor Mistah Piers.
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-06.png	We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-07.png	to all kin' o' boats, wid d'ose big, big
data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-08.png	rocks in an' out o' de water.
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-00.png	He had almost entirely settled back into his old
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-01.png	ways, even to reading law about two hours each
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-02.png	day. Though he did not refuse wine, which the
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-03.png	judge always had on the table at dinner, he
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-04.png	did not act as though he found it necessary
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-05.png	except in moderate compliance with his father's
data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-06.png	habit.
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-00.png	When the wind was on a rampage, as it was
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-01.png	now, it could kick up a sea-sized commotion
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-02.png	where it had a straight blow of eight miles
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-03.png	down the lake. 3&quot;Big blow, Judge,&quot; re-
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-04.png	marked Willie Kim as the wind billowed
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-05.png	out and sucked in his baggy black
data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-06.png	blouse and pantaloons.
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-00.png	3&quot;Blow like hell. Maybe by and by
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-01.png	she blow some more.&quot; &quot;Hello, Willie, where
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-02.png	did you come from?&quot; the judge said in
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-03.png	mild surprise. &quot;I didn't hear you. Do you
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-04.png	see that fool boy of mine out there on
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-05.png	the lake?&quot; 3&quot;I see him. You don't need
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-06.png	worry, Judge. Big wind like that can't
data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-07.png	drown good man.
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-00.png	Bill is good man, and Bueno Buck is raised on lake.
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-01.png	He no drown, too. Him, his mother throw him into
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-02.png	water to make him swim when he is born.
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-03.png	Maybe so Bill, he can swim that good, too.&quot;
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-04.png	The yawl, riding the high waves with an air that
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-05.png	might have made an ocean liner envious, seemed
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-06.png	prepared to make a safe though violent landing
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-07.png	when there came a sudden gust of wind
data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-08.png	from the west.
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-00.png	&quot;My God!&quot; the judge cried out. &quot;The boy
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-01.png	is going to try to make a landing on the
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-02.png	weather side of that pier! He'll wreck!&quot;
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-03.png	Willie Kim was speechless, only his slant
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-04.png	black eyes showing any emotion. With a
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-05.png	quick shift of tiller, and at the same time
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-06.png	jibbing the boom to which he had the
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-07.png	stay rope fastened, Bill made the
data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-08.png	yawl recover.
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-00.png	It seemed to the frightened judge
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-01.png	as though his son would actually
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-02.png	shoot the craft in under the outer
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-03.png	end of the wharf. But by pressing
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-04.png	the tiller hard over and at the
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-05.png	same time dropping the small sheet
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-06.png	of wet canvas, Bill cleared the
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-07.png	corner of the pier by inches, and
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-08.png	with the tiller still hard over, brought
data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-09.png	the yawl up against the waves
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-00.png	&quot;Willie,&quot; the judge said huskily,
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-01.png	&quot;that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-02.png	hip as I ever saw. That boy of
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-03.png	mine seems to know how to do
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-04.png	everything, when he wants to.&quot;
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-05.png	&quot;3Naw,&quot; disputed Willie. 3&quot;Just
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-06.png	play in damn fine luck this time.
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-07.png	He plenty smart though.&quot; As they
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-08.png	reached the pier, the judge on legs
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-09.png	that were a little unsteady, they
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-10.png	found Bueno Buck, now on the
data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-11.png	pier, leading the yawl toward
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-00.png	&quot;Hello, Dad!&quot; Bill called. &quot;I hope you
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-01.png	weren't worried. We're going to
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-02.png	drag the boat ashore and turn
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-03.png	her over. She has a foot of
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-04.png	water in her. I wouldn't be
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-05.png	surprised if we broke all
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-06.png	speed records on the way in.
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-07.png	Yes sir, I am slightly wet, and
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-08.png	Buck would be wetter if he
data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-09.png	had more clothes on.&quot;
data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-00.png	&quot;By George, that is a beautiful string of fish!&quot;
data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-01.png	exclaimed the judge. &quot;Toss them on the grass
data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-02.png	and then we'll all get hold and heave.&quot; A
data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-03.png	few moments later the yawl was upside
data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-04.png	down, exposing its shallow keel.
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-00.png	So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-01.png	famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-02.png	interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-03.png	bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-04.png	baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-05.png	went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-06.png	empty, save for the lady known by all habitue
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-07.png	*?2s as 'Seaweed', and a youngish, sharp-eyed
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-08.png	man who was staring moodily into a gin
data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-09.png	and tonic.
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-00.png	Seaweed's memory was prodigious; her manner
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-01.png	must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-02.png	of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-03.png	than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-04.png	glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-05.png	of the bar was not 6persona grata. If her
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-06.png	memory was good, so was this stranger's.
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-07.png	"You're Commander Winter," he said. "Have a
data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-08.png	gin?" He turned to Seaweed -
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-00.png	"Make it a large one, darling. I know the naval
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-01.png	habits. 'Drink gin and call each other wallahs,
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-02.png	what!' - as the Guards officer said on his return
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-03.png	from a visit to the Royal Navy. Submarines, what.
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-04.png	Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Crawled
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-05.png	inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-06.png	bomb. Should have been a V.C.
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-00.png	What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-01.png	obviously thirsty.&quot; John fought back his
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-02.png	inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-03.png	would have to leave the bar and either sit in
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-04.png	the lounge or return to his bedroom.
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-05.png	Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-06.png	came to the rescue. &quot;You haven't introduced
data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-07.png	yourself,&quot; she said with mock severity.
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-00.png	"It's a rule on these premises. No treating with
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-01.png	strangers - that's right, John, isn't it?" "My
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-02.png	fault entirely," said the stranger. "It's my conceited
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-03.png	nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-04.png	was. I'm Ian Bawley. Does that mean anything
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-05.png	to you?" It did. Ian Bawley's name was
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-06.png	printed at the head of most naval articles
data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-07.png	in the Daily Courier.
data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-00.png	John flushed. &quot;I'm not in need of charity.&quot; &quot;Come
data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-01.png	off it,&quot; said Bawley. &quot;The proprietor of the Daily
data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-02.png	Courier knows what's going on. If he doesn't mind,
data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-03.png	why should you?&quot; &quot;I see.&quot; John took the
data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-04.png	refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-05.png	companion. &quot;You want me to talk, is that it?&quot;
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-00.png	&quot;You misjudge me,&quot; said Bawley. &quot;You have
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-01.png	nothing to tell me, yet. But we'll be meeting
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-02.png	again, no doubt, and then you will have.
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-03.png	Regard this as a softening-up process, and
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-04.png	have dinner with me? On His Lordship,
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-05.png	of course.&quot; &quot;On one condition,&quot; said John.
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-06.png	&quot;Tell me who the little bird was.&quot; &quot;Can't
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-07.png	you guess? Whose portrait appears regularly
data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-08.png	in the shiny papers?&quot;
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-00.png	"You mean Munyard?" "Sure. Very useful
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-01.png	contact, is our Robbie; he gives us the gen and
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-02.png	we give him the publicity. 'The Honourable
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-03.png	"Robbie" and friend', what? You know the
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-04.png	sort of thing." "You'll get nothing out of me,"
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-05.png	said John, "but you can pay for my drinks
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-06.png	if you want to, as long as you keep off
data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-07.png	Service matters."
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-00.png	&quot;Good-oh! One for the grill-room, darling, and
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-01.png	tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour.&quot;
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-02.png	Bawley was a man of his word. He kept
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-03.png	away from Service matters, was an excellent
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-04.png	host and a splendid raconteur. The evening
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-05.png	passed all too quickly. As they parted in
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-06.png	the vestibule the two men were well
data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-07.png	disposed towards each other.
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-00.png	&quot;Ever been to Fleet Street?&quot; asked Bawley.
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-01.png	&quot;You should. Next time you're in Town
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-02.png	give me a ring at this number and I'll
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-03.png	take you round the pubs where most
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-04.png	of the work is done.&quot; He held out a card.
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-05.png	John took it and put it in his pocket.
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-06.png	&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;If ever my missus
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-07.png	lets me off the chain I'll take you
data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-08.png	up on that.
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-00.png	Ever been out in a submarine? I'll give
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-01.png	you a spin round one of these days, if you
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-02.png	like. You could write it up.&quot; Bawley made a face.
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-03.png	&quot;Not in Pericles, old man.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot;
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-04.png	&quot;Better ask Robbie Munyard.&quot; &quot;What's he been
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-05.png	saying?&quot; John was furious. The little squirt!
data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-06.png	To go gassing to a newspaper man!
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-00.png	&quot;Look!&quot; he went on earnestly. &quot;You're not going
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-01.png	to write up Pericles in some way or other, are
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-02.png	you?&quot; &quot;What is there to write up?&quot; said
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-03.png	Bawley. &quot;There are forty-three submarines in
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-04.png	the Navy - why should I pick on Pericles?&quot;
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-05.png	John eyed him steadily. &quot;It's the Parcifal
data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-06.png	business, isn't it?&quot; he said quietly.
data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-00.png	"I don't want it to happen again," said Bawley -
data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-01.png	"more so than ever since I met you."
data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-02.png	"What did Munyard say?" "The Snort - hull

data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-04.png	we've had Pericles' entire Snort equipment removed
data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-05.png	and X-rayed and that it was as sound as a bell?"
data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-06.png	said John.
data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-00.png	&quot;Munyard didn't tell me that. But I must confess
data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-01.png	I'm relieved. But it still doesn't do away
data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-02.png	with the possibility of faulty design.&quot; He held
data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-03.png	out his hand. &quot;Maybe I will take a trip with you
data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-04.png	one of these days,&quot; he said. &quot;In the meantime
data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-05.png	I'll tell my editor that the story's a dead bird.
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-00.png	Glad I met you. Don't forget to give me a ring -
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-01.png	any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley, what?&quot;
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-02.png	&quot;I don't know when that will be,&quot; said John.
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-03.png	&quot;I shall be busy for a while, cleaning up after
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-04.png	Master bloody Munyard.&quot; THERE were six submarines,
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-05.png	lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse.
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-06.png	Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-07.png	sounded, for all of them were rumbling as they
data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-08.png	charged their electric batteries.
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-00.png	A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-01.png	through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-02.png	pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-03.png	Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-04.png	a substantial breakfast. Although usually a very
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-05.png	talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-06.png	silences, for she knew they betokened a worry of
data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-07.png	some sort.
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-00.png	There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-01.png	affair of Parsifal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight.
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-02.png	His normal placid and steady-going manner remained,
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-03.png	but she could see that it no longer came naturally.
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-04.png	It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-05.png	to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-06.png	though in peace time these happenings are few and
data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-07.png	far between.
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-00.png	This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-01.png	a national disaster and then when it is all over life
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-02.png	must continue as before. During this period the Captain
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-03.png	must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-04.png	if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-05.png	written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-06.png	locality, had been interviewed by the Press, had driven
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-07.png	his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-08.png	usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-09.png	suitable for such occasions.
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-00.png	He rode down to where I was waiting. I was
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-01.png	thinking what a skill he had for reading
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-02.png	my mind. &quot;This would be as good a place
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-03.png	for a hold-up as any,&quot; he said, reining in
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-04.png	near me. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;It'll be here to-
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-05.png	morrow as likely as not.&quot; I paused. &quot;Miss
data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-06.png	Jeannie'll be on that coach, Dan.&quot;
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-00.png	&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;I know.&quot; &quot;No harm must come
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-01.png	to her, Dan.&quot; &quot;She'll be all right. It's the
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-02.png	men who'll be after that coach I'm interested
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-03.png	in, Johnny.&quot; &quot;I know. But if lead starts
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-04.png	flying she might be in danger.&quot; &quot;That's so.
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-05.png	But I reckon they'll be too busy shooting at
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-06.png	us to bother with the coach and the folks
data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-07.png	in it.&quot;
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-00.png	&quot;Maybe,&quot; I said. &quot;But we've got to remember
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-01.png	that girl all the time, Dan. I feel kind
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-02.png	of responsible for her.&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; he said,
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-03.png	giving me one of his strange looks. Then he
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-04.png	turned the conversation. &quot;Let's ride over
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-05.png	and have a look at the mining camp.
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-06.png	After all it's them we're supposed to be
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-07.png	working for, as well as the townsfolk and
data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-08.png	the agency detective.&quot;
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-00.png	With something of a start I remembered the
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-01.png	man who'd brought us into this business.
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-02.png	&quot;Maybe you don't know about Appleton,
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-03.png	Dan?&quot; &quot;Know what?&quot; &quot;That he's dead,&quot;
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-04.png	I said. I watched him because I was always
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-05.png	fascinated by the way he looked when you
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-06.png	tried to surprise him. &quot;Dead?&quot; he said. &quot;Yes.
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-07.png	Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-08.png	down with a shotgun outside the Palace
data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-09.png	last night.&quot;
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-00.png	&quot;Fenton or Somers,&quot; he said. &quot;Or the Town
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-01.png	Marshal,&quot; I added. His face was fixed,
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-02.png	unreadable as a rock. &quot;Let's get over to the
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-03.png	mining camp,&quot; he said abruptly. He wheeled
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-04.png	his horse back off the trail and up the slope
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-05.png	leading to the ridge. I followed. From the
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-06.png	top you could see something of the wild hill
data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-07.png	country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing.
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-00.png	The air was fresh and clear and you
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-01.png	could see far over west and north for many
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-02.png	miles. The real high country of the Rockies
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-03.png	lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-04.png	colour drawing. Between us and that lay
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-05.png	a vast stretch of hills, canyons, buttes and
data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-06.png	malpais.
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-00.png	&quot;The mine-workings lie north of the town,&quot;
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-01.png	said Dan. &quot;If we head west we ought to
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-02.png	cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north.&quot;
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-03.png	So we swung west, making slow going over
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-04.png	rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-05.png	into draws, circling a big mesa by a
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-06.png	four or five mile valley, sandy-floored. It
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-07.png	got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-08.png	gratefully by a small creek where we watered
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-09.png	the horses and drank enough to cure our
data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-10.png	thirst.
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-00.png	An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-01.png	we figured would lead to the miners' camp.
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-02.png	We turned north into it and after about four
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-03.png	miles it led into a small canyon which
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-04.png	opened out into a wide shallow draw.
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-05.png	Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-06.png	the miners at work. They were scattered
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-07.png	over a fairly wide area working singly or
data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-08.png	in pairs.
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-00.png	We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-01.png	of the diggings there was a roughly-built
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-02.png	shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-03.png	out, &quot;If you come any closer, I'll sure blow
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-04.png	your whiskers off.&quot; &quot;Take it easy, mister,&quot; I sang
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-05.png	out. &quot;We don't aim to come any closer and we've
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-06.png	got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-07.png	go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-08.png	to him about what happened last night.&quot;
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-00.png	&quot;Oh,&quot; said the unseen guard. He blew a
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-01.png	whistle then, loud and shrill. The gun barrel
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-02.png	peeking out through a hole in the shack never
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-03.png	wavered. We sat our horses, waiting. &quot;Looks as
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-04.png	though they're expecting trouble,&quot; I said. &quot;Where
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-05.png	there's gold and women there's always trouble,&quot;
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-06.png	observed Dan, shifting about in his saddle. He
data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-07.png	was never long on patience.
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-00.png	Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-01.png	outbuilding, but this was happening to him now. He
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-02.png	saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed, repressed
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-03.png	boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-04.png	baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to.
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-05.png	Walking out of the chapel later on. Continuing
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-06.png	on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-07.png	canery and corruption, the growth of the dea-
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-08.png	dly decadence and absorption in debase-
data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-09.png	ment and Satanic debauchery.
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-00.png	"Yes. I travelled down from London
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-01.png	as the dawn was breaking, and
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-02.png	the thought came to me I'd like
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-03.png	to take a look at the church. I've
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-04.png	never been inside. Very remiss of
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-05.png	me," said Mr. Copthorne. The verger
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-06.png	led the way in. "The stained glass
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-07.png	windows, sir, they date back to
data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-08.png	the fourteenth century."
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-00.png	There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-01.png	quickly through the customs. &quot;Gay!&quot; &quot;Gavin!&quot; The girl
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-02.png	and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-03.png	together. The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-04.png	taxi. &quot;Just a moment, darling,&quot; Gavin pressed her
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-05.png	hand and smiled. &quot;I want to check up on the
data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-06.png	flights back.&quot;
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-00.png	Gay went out to the waiting
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-01.png	taxi, and then found that in
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-02.png	the excitement of meeting
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-03.png	Gavin she had left her sun-
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-04.png	glasses on the veranda. She
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-05.png	went quickly back to fetch them.
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-06.png	Gavin and the girl who had got
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-07.png	off the plane with him were talking.
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-08.png	He was writing something in his
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-09.png	pocket-book, with a sick feeling
data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-10.png	of despair Gay knew that of course
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-00.png	Gay, sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-01.png	hardly believe that she was the same girl,
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-02.png	miserable, shy, who had sat at the little
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-03.png	table for the first time a few days ago.
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-04.png	Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-05.png	and Gay's heart turned over. &quot;I'd like
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-06.png	to do that.&quot; Gavin drained his glass
data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-07.png	and refilled it.
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-00.png	&quot;And then we'll go for a stroll along the
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-01.png	beach. A moon like this mustn't be wasted.&quot;
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-02.png	He gestured towards the bay where the full
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-03.png	moon was just rising over the rocks, then
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-04.png	laid his hand on hers. Gay smiled at him
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-05.png	again, happy beyond belief, knowing that
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-06.png	now Gavin was in love with her and her
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-07.png	only, yet remembering for a second the
data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-08.png	kisses she had seen him giving Elaine.
data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-00.png	All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She
data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-01.png	would never be jealous again, would even take Larry's advice and
data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-02.png	look the other way if need be. &quot;I say!&quot; Gavin was looking over her
data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-03.png	shoulder. &quot;That's a pretty girl!&quot; Gay glanced behind her, &quot;Isn't she
data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-04.png	lovely, she's French, a very well known model I believe.
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-00.png	Gay, a little puzzled, went through
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-01.png	to the bar. Doc and Lilyan were
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-02.png	sitting just inside having coffee.
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-03.png	&quot;Come and join us and bring your
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-04.png	boy friend,&quot; Doc called. &quot;No, Doc!&quot;
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-05.png	Lilyan remonstrated. &quot;They want to be
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-06.png	alone.&quot; &quot;I've booked a table at the
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-07.png	cafe*?2,&quot; Doc said, &quot;they are packed
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-08.png	tonight so come and join us if you
data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-09.png	can't find a table for two.&quot;
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-00.png	The others were all dancing and
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-01.png	as Gay drew out a chair and sat
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-02.png	down Gavin, without a word, swept
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-03.png	Simone on to the floor. &quot;It doesn't mean
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-04.png	anything,&quot; Gay told herself desperately,
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-05.png	trying to understand Gavin's point of
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-06.png	view and remembering the advice
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-07.png	that Larry had given her, while she
data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-08.png	felt wretched beyond words.
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-00.png	Gay thanked him and walked out on to
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-01.png	the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-02.png	had bought a drink and taken it outside.
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-03.png	She looked round scanning the tables,
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-04.png	then caught her breath, a cold hand
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-05.png	seeming to clutch her heart. Gavin was
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-06.png	seated at a small table in a shadowy
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-07.png	corner talking animatedly to Simone.
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-08.png	As Gay watched he offered the girl a
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-09.png	cigarette and lit it, his hands cupping
data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-10.png	hers in an intimate way.
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-00.png	Gay stood irresolute for a moment, half
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-01.png	decided to go back and join Lilyan and
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-02.png	Doc, while she wanted to do no more than
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-03.png	run upstairs to her room, knowing that
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-04.png	Gavin although he had told her that he
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-05.png	loved her, was already flirting with a girl
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-06.png	that he had only met a few minutes before.
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-07.png	Larry's advice flashed through her mind,
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-08.png	but she turned away, giving a little
data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-09.png	gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-00.png	Sentence Database P02-109
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-01.png	-----------------------------------------------------
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-02.png	"And that's the man whom you have been eating your
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-03.png	heart out over?" Doc nodded towards the door. "You
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-04.png	may consider him a man, I would say he was a
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-05.png	mentally adolescent cad." "Oh, Doc ..." Gay protested
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-06.png	weakly, "you don't know Gavin." "I've only met him
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-07.png	today but I think I can safely say that I know
data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-08.png	him a great deal better than you do."
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-00.png	Doc gave her hand a shake. &quot;Wake up
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-01.png	Gay, and don't even contemplate throwing
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-02.png	yourself away on a chap like that. You're a
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-03.png	fine girl, intelligent, and pretty, and I had
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-04.png	thought you were sensible too. Don't
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-05.png	make a fool of yourself over someone
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-06.png	who doesn't care two jots for your feelings.
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-07.png	If he behaves like this now what is your
data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-08.png	married life going to be like?
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-00.png	Gay nodded. "I know that you're right Doc, I think
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-01.png	now that I do realise that, and in any case," she added
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-02.png	a little sadly, "if I did change Gavin, he wouldn't
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-03.png	be the same, if you know what I mean." "You sound
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-04.png	like Alice in Wonderland," Doc gently mocked her, "and
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-05.png	I'm glad you're beginning to see that you're wasting
data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-06.png	your time on that chap.
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-00.png	Now let him go and you won't have to wait
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-01.png	long for the right man for you to come
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-02.png	along. If I was thirty years younger and weren't
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-03.png	married to the sweetest wife in the world
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-04.png	I'd marry you myself.&quot; Gay laughed, Doc was
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-05.png	so kind and nice and she hoped that one
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-06.png	day she would be able to see the situation
data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-07.png	as it obviously appeared to everyone else.
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-00.png	Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-01.png	again Gay found herself alone at the table
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-02.png	feeling self-conscious and awkward, sure that
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-03.png	people were talking about the way Gavin
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-04.png	was behaving since they had seen them
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-05.png	dining together. She opened her bag
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-06.png	to get out her compact and saw Grace's
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-07.png	letter. She drew it out and opened it,
data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-08.png	glad to be able to occupy herself.
data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-00.png	&quot;So glad that you are having such a lovely time, dearie,&quot;
data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-01.png	it ran. &quot;Your cards are lovely. I rang up Miss Harland
data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-02.png	and have been over to sit with her father and do what
data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-03.png	I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping.
data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-04.png	He's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-05.png	broken arm.
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-00.png	No other news except that Elaine is engaged
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-01.png	and going to marry a foreigner ...&quot;
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-02.png	Gay read the rest of the letter then put
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-03.png	it back in her bag. Elaine was engaged,
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-04.png	to the man she had spent so much time
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-05.png	with at her party. That was why
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-06.png	Gavin had come back to her.
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-07.png	Everything was quite clear now, and to
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-08.png	her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak,
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-09.png	rather a sense of relief now that she
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-10.png	knew why Gavin had come to see
data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-11.png	her.
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-00.png	Because she was second best. The others came back
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-01.png	to the table, all of them making a fuss of her and at once
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-02.png	she felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm sympathy,
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-03.png	knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new ones.
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-04.png	&quot;That is a pretty dress,&quot; Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-05.png	Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-06.png	understand, knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-07.png	for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-08.png	was hurt for herself.
data/p02/p02-155/p02-155-00.png	&quot;I made it myself,&quot; Gay tried to speak
data/p02/p02-155/p02-155-01.png	normally.
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-00.png	&quot;There are all sorts of wonder-
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-01.png	ful jobs in London and I could
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-02.png	take my pick, whereas in Yarmouth
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-03.png	one has to know something about fishing
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-04.png	and in Liverpool they'd want sea-farers.
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-05.png	I don't think I'd go to Edinburgh un-
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-06.png	less I was a Scot and wanting to get
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-07.png	home, or perhaps a student studying to
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-08.png	be a doctor, and I already know
data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-09.png	all about that.&quot;
data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-00.png	She was engaged to Nigel, had been for two years.
data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-01.png	Sometimes they talked on the theme of &quot;when we get married&quot;,
data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-02.png	and then all was wonderful, and perhaps it had only been
data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-03.png	a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said, only last
data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-04.png	evening, &quot;If we get married, old girl, you'll have to stop
data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-05.png	that lark, I can tell you!&quot;
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-00.png	She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-01.png	which 'lark' she would have to stop, only that significant tiny
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-02.png	word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning, and
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-03.png	with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information,
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-04.png	which now took on an ominous significance: Nigel had been
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-05.png	seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-06.png	been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-07.png	Little Phelpham.
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-00.png	Now Nigel had every right to go where he
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-01.png	liked during his off-duty periods
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-02.png	when she was not free; this much they had
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-03.png	conceded one to the other. They rarely
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-04.png	found they were off duty together, and
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-05.png	the situation would have been intolerable
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-06.png	had there not been some give and take
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-07.png	about their relationship. So when Nigel
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-08.png	had told her about taking Luke's
data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-09.png	evening surgery she had said,
data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-00.png	&quot;Bless you! I hope Luke is suitably grateful, darling.&quot; &quot;Oh, well,&quot;
data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-01.png	he shrugged diffidently, &quot;I like the work. One gets plenty
data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-02.png	of variety and it's a change.&quot; Nigel was the hospital's
data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-03.png	Junior Medical Officer. &quot;You won't be free about nine, I
data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-04.png	suppose, to meet me for supper somewhere?&quot; she had
data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-05.png	asked hopefully.
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-00.png	&quot;Hardly likely, my sweet. Luke's surgery goes on for
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-01.png	hours. If they get in before eight-thirty, even
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-02.png	though they're standing on one another's toes,
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-03.png	I've got to see 'em. If I am free, though,
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-04.png	I'll give you a ring, O.K.?&quot; O.K.,&quot; she had
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-05.png	replied readily. So how could Nigel have
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-06.png	been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse,
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-07.png	dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-08.png	very evening?
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-00.png	&quot;No,&quot; she told Phil Gubbins, a junior
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-01.png	houseman, &quot;it wasn't Nigel you saw,
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-02.png	my lad.&quot; &quot;It was Nigel's car, anyway.
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-03.png	NUF 121.&quot; &quot;He probably loaned his car
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-04.png	to somebody, Phil. He's always doing that.&quot;
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-05.png	Young Gubbins shrugged. &quot;I didn't see his
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-06.png	face, Di, but it certainly looked like
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-07.png	Nigel from the back. D.j. and all.
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-08.png	Of course such as I couldn't afford
data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-09.png	to go into the Load of Trouble.&quot;
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-00.png	But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-01.png	realised it was important enough for her to have remembered, and it
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-02.png	was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-03.png	made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead.
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-04.png	&quot;Nigel,&quot; she had besought him, &quot;you know that evening
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-05.png	you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-06.png	with a cyst on her ear ... ?&quot;
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-00.png	&quot;5Ye-es?&quot; he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-01.png	mouth, an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge.
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-02.png	&quot;What about it, my sweet?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; she laughed
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-03.png	suddenly in an upsurging of relief, &quot;that stupid
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-04.png	Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble.
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-05.png	With a blonde, too. Imagine!&quot; Nigel was frowning. He
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-06.png	looked distinguished when he frowned; boyishly
data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-07.png	handsome at other times.
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-00.png	&quot;Gubbins? Gubbins?&quot; he fretted. &quot;Who's he?&quot;
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-01.png	Though Diana knew the name of every
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-02.png	member of the staff, distinguished or not,
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-03.png	Nigel often had to think hard to sort
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-04.png	them out. &quot;He's the carrotty lad, isn't he?&quot;
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-05.png	he now demanded. &quot;What was he
data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-06.png	doing at the Load of Trouble?&quot;
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-00.png	I'm going with a shooting party. What else can I do
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-01.png	at this time of year? I can't ask you up because it's
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-02.png	a strictly stag affair.&quot; &quot;I know. I didn't expect ...&quot; &quot;Well,
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-03.png	don't keep hinting, then. You wish you could
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-04.png	come with me; you hope I'll miss you; you
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-05.png	can't imagine the hospital without me for
data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-06.png	three weeks, etcetera, etcetera!&quot;
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-00.png	Her figure was small and exquisite, like a schoolgirl's still, and
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-01.png	he admired her legs, which the male sex were inclined to
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-02.png	regard first. &quot;I would mind if you didn't&quot; he told her
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-03.png	grimly, and tugged her fiercely into his arms. &quot;You're
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-04.png	right, pet. I do need this leave. I'm bad-tempered and
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-05.png	broody and going out with brash blondes. I don't deserve
data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-06.png	you.&quot;
data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-00.png	&quot;Isn't it?&quot; he rose and smoothed himself
data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-01.png	down. &quot;Ask any bridegroom-to-be. Anyhow,

data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-03.png	the moment, thank God!&quot; Problem ... ?
data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-04.png	looming ... ? &quot;Are we discussing a marriage
data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-05.png	or a burial?&quot; she asked, hardly believing
data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-06.png	he could be serious. &quot;Surely marrying
data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-07.png	me isn't going to be all that bad?
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-00.png	If it is -&quot; she laughed uncertainly - &quot;you can have
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-01.png	your ring back.&quot; She loosened the half-hoop of
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-02.png	diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-03.png	out to him, still playfully. Without a glimmer
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-04.png	of amusement in his own eyes, however, he took
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-05.png	it, looking moodily beyond her. &quot;Perhaps it's as
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-06.png	well if you don't wear it for a bit, Di,&quot; he
data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-07.png	told her.
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-00.png	"But I want it!" she protested. "It's my ring."
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-01.png	"You just gave it back to me." "I
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-02.png	didn't! I was joking. You know I was
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-03.png	joking, Nigel." "You shouldn't joke
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-04.png	about serious things like engagements."
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-05.png	"Don't be such a baby!" They were going
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-06.png	to have an open quarrel
data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-07.png	any minute, and she knew it.
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-00.png	Thus had they parted the previous evening and now
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-01.png	Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-02.png	alone. Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-03.png	doctor would be free during the day; tea was served
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-04.png	from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-05.png	room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-06.png	Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention,
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-07.png	she was convinced, or he would have granted her small request
data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-08.png	to be met at the gates.

data/p03/p03-189/p03-189-01.png	They often had such a rendezvous, for
data/p03/p03-189/p03-189-02.png	there was just time to smoke a cigarette,
data/p03/p03-189/p03-189-03.png	if one walked slowly, between road and
data/p03/p03-189/p03-189-04.png	hospital.
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-00.png	His mouth hardened, his eyes became
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-01.png	steely. 'I see.' Scorn lashed his
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-02.png	words. 'I wonder you dared trust
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-03.png	him to my care.' 'Nicholas -'
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-04.png	'Well! At least I know the truth.
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-05.png	Truth!' His gaze held hers
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-06.png	masterfully. 'You wanted it so
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-07.png	badly - at any price. I hope
data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-08.png	you are satisfied.'
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-00.png	And as he spoke, the thought
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-01.png	of Philip lying in the other
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-02.png	room filled him with a re-
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-03.png	vulsion that was homicidal.
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-04.png	Even in that, his hands were
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-05.png	tied. He dare not precipitate
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-06.png	what might well be another
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-07.png	coronary. And in that second
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-08.png	he put back his professional
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-09.png	mantle, and said with such
data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-10.png	icy politeness, such withdrawn
data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-00.png	'I will leave you the necessary pre-

data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-05.png	his fountain-pen from his
data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-06.png	waistcoat pocket, take out

data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-09.png	with a gesture she knew so well,
data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-10.png	he tore off the leaflet and
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-00.png	'Good-bye, Sandra,' he said
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-01.png	with a deadly finality. Watching
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-02.png	him go, unable to speak, she
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-03.png	felt that part of her was leaving
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-04.png	him. She couldn't hate him...
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-05.png	If only he would have con-
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-06.png	fided in her, given some expla-
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-07.png	nation. Now there was no-
data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-08.png	thing - not even friendship.
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-00.png	She went back to Philip. But
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-01.png	all she could hear were Nicholas's
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-02.png	words: 'I love you - oh, you
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-03.png	know that well enough.'
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-04.png	Love. She revolted against
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-05.png	the word. Nicholas, Philip...
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-06.png	where was happiness, or
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-07.png	peace of mind? Philip put out
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-08.png	a hand and grasped hers.
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-09.png	He needed her. She would find
data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-10.png	solace in that fact at least.
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-00.png	She had her truth. How much had built
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-01.png	up from that first ideal, and how
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-02.png	little joy, or satisfaction, it had
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-03.png	given her. 'I'm sorry, darling.'
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-04.png	He looked nervous. It had been
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-05.png	hell lying there, knowing she was
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-06.png	talking to Nicholas and wondering
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-07.png	what they were saying. Sandra
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-08.png	said instinctively: 'I told him
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-09.png	I knew he was responsible for
data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-10.png	Beryl's death.'
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-00.png	Her eyes darkened in torment. 'Are
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-01.png	you sure that she was telling the truth?'
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-02.png	'Good heavens, darling, why on earth
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-03.png	should she lie? Besides, it wasn't just
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-04.png	her word. There was enough evidence,
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-05.png	no matter how one might want to
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-06.png	disbelieve the facts.' Elation
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-07.png	touched him after the cold wind
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-08.png	of suspense. 'It will be interesting
data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-09.png	to see what comes out at the inquest.
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-00.png	What his story will be. I reckon
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-01.png	he'll confine himself to the nervous
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-02.png	origin of her recent illness. His notes
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-03.png	will be truthful, but what he leaves out
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-04.png	will matter most.' Strange how just
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-05.png	then Philip was so certain that Nicholas
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-06.png	would never betray him. He loved
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-07.png	Sandra too deeply to ruin her
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-08.png	future happiness. Had ever circum-
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-09.png	stances conspired so cunningly?
data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-10.png	Philip's spirits soared.
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-00.png	He was better; he had made a
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-01.png	miraculous recovery and Sandra would
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-02.png	soon be his wife. The Devil, he thought,
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-03.png	certainly looked after his own.
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-04.png	Something in Sandra's attitude struck
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-05.png	him suddenly, making him say:
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-06.png	'You can't forgive him for this -
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-07.png	can you?' 'Forgive is an unctuous,
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-08.png	patronizing word,' she replied. 'I despise
data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-09.png	the deceit. The lies.'
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-00.png	He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-01.png	drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-02.png	self-employed. By the time his monthly salary
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-03.png	arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-04.png	their share, and there were precious few
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-05.png	reductions in tax save for wives, children,
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-06.png	life-insurances or any of the other normal
data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-07.png	encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided.
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-00.png	At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-01.png	had claimed tax relief on the pur-
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-02.png	chase of several mink coats which,
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-03.png	it seemed, were necessary to fur-
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-04.png	ther her career. Alternatively, it
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-05.png	was reported, she tearfully claimed
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-06.png	that the warm coats were heating
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-07.png	appliances and therefore susceptible
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-08.png	to a depreciation tax allowance
data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-09.png	as plant and machinery. The
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-00.png	Between all the interested parties, the final
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-01.png	agreement had been delayed long enough for
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-02.png	Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-03.png	by rights should have been reserved for her tax.
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-04.png	Discounting one chinchilla jacket, a Rolls-
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-05.png	Royce and a Sussex manor house, all
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-06.png	three of which were in her husband's name,
data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-07.png	she now declared herself bankrupt.
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-00.png	'It's not mine. I wasn't sitting there.' She blinked
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-01.png	disdainfully at him and stepped out.
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-02.png	It was a new briefcase, and as the train jogged along
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-03.png	the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil.
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-04.png	He wondered what it contained. Probably the remains
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-05.png	of someone's lunch or a few secret files.
data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-06.png	He smiled at his own joke.
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-00.png	Cecil searched in his pockets once
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-01.png	more and came up with two
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-02.png	paper-clips. After a few seconds
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-03.png	of twisting, he roughly thrust a
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-04.png	bent wire loop into the lock and
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-05.png	waggled it around vigorously.
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-06.png	There was a click and the
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-07.png	briefcase opened. Cecil thrust an
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-08.png	eager hand inside, his fingers
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-09.png	groping after wads of five
data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-10.png	pound notes.
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-00.png	They closed on a single bundle and, fumbling with
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-01.png	nervous excitement, he pulled it out. His eye
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-02.png	rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-03.png	side. 'Old fashioned fivers!' he muttered again, and
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-04.png	tried to recall if they were still legal tender. Surely the
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-05.png	Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-06.png	break their promise to pay on rude demand, let
data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-07.png	alone on polite request.
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-00.png	He climbed the stairs, eager to unload the
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-01.png	guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-02.png	to emerge carrying his shame unseen, but burning,
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-03.png	into the night. He reached the barrier and
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-04.png	fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-05.png	briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-06.png	intention of playing the dutiful citizen

data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-00.png	Sentence Database
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-01.png	Before he could open his mouth, the collector
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-02.png	stretched out a hand. 'Watch your step there, sir! Your briefcase
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-03.png	is hanging open. You'll have someone shoving their hot
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-04.png	little hands inside. Here, I'll do it.' The collector pressed the twinkling
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-05.png	catch home with a click. Cecil, irretrievably laden with
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-06.png	both briefcase and conscience, stumbled away
data/r02/r02-081/r02-081-07.png	into the darkness.
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-00.png	'HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day?' His mother came into
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-01.png	the hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-02.png	and, turning his back to her, contrived to slide the brief-
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-03.png	case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-04.png	and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-05.png	which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-06.png	brella stand. 'You're later than usual, aren't you?'
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-07.png	His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-08.png	they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-09.png	for the labels from half a hundredweight of
data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-10.png	Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea.
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-00.png	Cecil stepped towards the dining room. 'I'm
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-01.png	sure you must be tired,' his mother insisted.
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-02.png	'You're very irritable, anyway.' 'I'm NOT tired
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-03.png	and I'm NOT irritable.' 'Very well then.' His
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-04.png	mother nodded with understanding. 'You're not tired.
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-05.png	Nobody's tired. Now just you run along
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-06.png	upstairs and wash your hands whilst I get
data/r02/r02-117/r02-117-07.png	dinner ready.'
data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-00.png	Your Auntie Edie's coming in for a cup of tea later and
data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-01.png	you know how she has a good look round everywhere.' There was
data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-02.png	a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard. Cecil's
data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-03.png	mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-04.png	against the brass umbrella stand. 'Well now!' She hurried
data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-05.png	towards it and picked it up.
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-00.png	'What have we here? A new briefcase! So THAT'S
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-01.png	what it's all about.' Cecil halted in
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-02.png	mid-step near the top of the stairs and
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-03.png	clenched his fists. 'So that's what
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-04.png	What's all about?' he hissed without
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-05.png	turning round. She pointed to the
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-06.png	briefcase. 'So that's why you are so
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-07.png	irritable. You thought that I'd think
data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-08.png	you'd been extravagant.'
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-00.png	In spite of all the transferred maternity
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-01.png	she was endowed with by her patients,
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-02.png	poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-03.png	a buyer of property. No, not even an
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-04.png	infant-in-arms but a new-born babe, a
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-05.png	premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-06.png	tent of utter innocence. The complexity of
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-07.png	that innocence was colossal. It had layer
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-08.png	after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-09.png	replaced with sad knowledgeability.
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-00.png	It was a nakedness of nai&quot;vety to be
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-01.png	clothed leaf by leaf with the disappointment
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-02.png	of experience. Her first illusion consisted in
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-03.png	the belief that all she need do was to go to
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-04.png	an agent, visit half a dozen houses in one
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-05.png	day, choose one, make an offer, put it in
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-06.png	the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-07.png	holiday while the whole transaction was
data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-08.png	put through.
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-00.png	&quot;Of course you must count about two hundred
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-01.png	for legal charges and stamp duties,
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-02.png	maybe less, depending on the price of the
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-03.png	house, and whether it has been regis-
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-04.png	tered. I take it you have a mortgage lined
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-05.png	up, then, Mrs. - er - Buttery?&quot; &quot;Not yet,
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-06.png	but the bank would give me a loan, I'm
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-07.png	sure.&quot; &quot;Er, yes. You have some securities,
data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-08.png	then?&quot;
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-00.png	His aspect was as dusty as his office, with scurf
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-01.png	from dusty hair on the dusty shoulders of his black
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-02.png	suit, cigarette ash down the front, an ashen face
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-03.png	and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-04.png	grey eyes. His finger-nails were dirty, though he
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-05.png	tried to make up for it by constantly paring them
data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-06.png	with the finger-nail of the opposite hand.
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-00.png	&quot;Yes, well....&quot; He judged that she had been sufficiently
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-01.png	dazzled and gave a long raucous cough. &quot;Only
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-02.png	cigarettes worth smoking, these. Most unhealthy, English
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-03.png	ones. Well, now, let me see. I think I can put you onto
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-04.png	some people who might, I say might, let you have a mortgage on
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-05.png	this property....&quot; &quot;But, they're safe, are they? I mean,
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-06.png	they're not - money-lenders?&quot; &quot;Mrs. - er - Buttery,
data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-07.png	all mortgage companies are money-lenders.
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-00.png	That's rather the point, isn't it?&quot; &quot;No, but I mean -&quot;
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-01.png	&quot;I know what you mean. You may trust me, Mrs.
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-02.png	Buttery. I think, however, that you might have
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-03.png	to revise your ideas about - er - the type of
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-04.png	property you intend to purchase.&quot; She revised
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-05.png	them. The little man from the Inter-Insular
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-06.png	(British Archipelago) Insurance Company soon
data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-07.png	saw to that.
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-00.png	I'm afraid we can't take yours into account
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-01.png	at all. It's a rule of I.I.I. You see, you
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-02.png	might stop work to have - well, for all sorts of
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-03.png	reasons, or you might leave him." "But how
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-04.png	utterly extraordinary," said Serena angrily,
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-05.png	"you must be living in the nineteenth century."
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-06.png	"Oh, but it's a very general rule, Mrs. Buttery,
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-07.png	you'll find that no insurance companies,
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-08.png	or building societies, for that matter, will
data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-09.png	allow for the wife's earnings.
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-00.png	Our lawyers -&quot; &quot;Who are your lawyers?&quot;
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-01.png	&quot;Clacton's.&quot; &quot;Well, I'm damned.&quot; &quot;Now, let me see,
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-02.png	you say your husband earns about ... yes,
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-03.png	that would come to ... three, carry seven, six
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-04.png	nines are fifty four - of course we'd have to
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-05.png	have some sort of proof, you know, it's very
data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-06.png	difficult with self-employed persons, carry two.
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-00.png	Yes. I'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-01.png	than three thousand three fifty at the most. Now you
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-02.png	could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-03.png	Grimstead for three thousand, that's where I live, just
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-04.png	before the green belt, lovely and modern, you know.
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-05.png	I forgot to tell you, we don't usually lend any
data/r03/r03-096/r03-096-06.png	house built earlier than 1918.&quot;
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-00.png	&quot;You see,&quot; she propounded to Rupert after her last patient
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-01.png	had gone, &quot;we can get three thousand three fifty,
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-02.png	perhaps a little more if we can cheat your earnings
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-03.png	a bit. I'm sure you could raise the rest from
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-04.png	one of your publishers, get two books commissioned
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-05.png	and write them later. I've got a bit owing too.
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-06.png	Now, I saw some flats in Hendon for four thou,
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-07.png	and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty,
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-08.png	two beds, two reception, k. and b., just think,
data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-09.png	our own bathroom.
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-00.png	No, he hadn't read it; Madame did all the
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-01.png	reading. Lawrence died in this very place.
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-02.png	He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-03.png	again. No, he couldn't really remember
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-04.png	him, he was one of the crowd. The
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-05.png	sun came out; Mart went shopping; I
data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-06.png	sat in the square reading the Patriote.
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-00.png	There was a front-page rear-attack on de
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-01.png	Gaulle, and the rest of the paper was given up
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-02.png	to murders, apart for an outcry against a
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-03.png	proposal to drop radio-active material into
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-04.png	the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-05.png	Raphael. All the murders were well documented
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-06.png	and had the air of being written by an
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-07.png	ingenious, but mad film director of the
data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-08.png	Thirties.
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-00.png	They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses.
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-01.png	Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-02.png	throttled to death by his wife, children and
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-03.png	father-in-law, after muddling up some sheep
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-04.png	while the worse for drink. The family
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-05.png	group then sat down for a late lunch
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-06.png	before the father-in-law telephoned the police.
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-07.png	Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-08.png	troubles, had written to the local
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-09.png	paper and the superintendent of police,
data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-10.png	informing them that he was on the point
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-00.png	Monsieur V's house was immediately
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-01.png	surrounded by firemen and other officials,
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-02.png	but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-03.png	a few minutes later from a nearby village,
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-04.png	apologising for the trouble, but explaining
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-05.png	that the walls were porous and the
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-06.png	gas had escaped. General relief was
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-07.png	expressed, but Monsieur V (this was
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-08.png	actually reported in the next issue) returned
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-09.png	home and shot himself, leaving a note
data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-10.png	which again left his household goods
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-00.png	Some grim comic relief was provided by
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-01.png	an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-02.png	who hid himself in a bush and imitated
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-03.png	a blackbird. Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-04.png	was after this very bird and shot the farm-
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-05.png	labourer in the face. All, however,
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-06.png	ended well, reported the paper, since the
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-07.png	pellets were easily removed and the
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-08.png	labourer was able to return to work the
data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-09.png	same afternoon.
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-00.png	We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta.
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-01.png	You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-02.png	way. In the middle of the journey is a
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-03.png	valley with a sea of vines and olives
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-04.png	and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-05.png	the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-06.png	islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-07.png	towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging
data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-08.png	like limpets to the rock.
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-00.png	There is a curd of morning smoke and
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-01.png	a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-02.png	stopped, as in fine weather we always
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-03.png	stopped. Down below is the village of
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-04.png	Cagnes, but between are pockets of
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-05.png	heat and cold like the hands of
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-06.png	friends or strangers, and a flurry of
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-07.png	early smells, the dark bosoms of
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-08.png	beech and the thin pine fingers
data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-09.png	kissed by the sun.
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-00.png	Then here was Nice, and the old holiday
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-01.png	sea, blue as a new school exercise
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-02.png	book. The same old Nice, creamy,
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-03.png	vulgar, out of time, bitter-sweet with
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-04.png	the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-05.png	prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-06.png	to the old sleeping port. This, and
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-07.png	Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-08.png	could catch the taste of dead dreams on
data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-09.png	my tongue like spray.
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-00.png	We parked the Lambretta opposite the
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-01.png	Negresco, and went to the beach to
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-02.png	have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-03.png	in our eyes. The sea boiled with waves,
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-04.png	they galloped to the walls and spumed
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-05.png	over the Promenade des Anglais. A huge
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-06.png	crowd had collected. There were firemen
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-07.png	and policemen and ambulances, and the
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-08.png	eyes of the spectators were hard with
data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-09.png	disaster.
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-00.png	They all had that neat look of
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-01.png	Mediterranean people to whom nothing
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-02.png	could ever happen, the chosen sane, the
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-03.png	uncuckolded, unrobbed, sheltered from
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-04.png	disease and accident by doctors, God and
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-05.png	the municipality. Yet, at any time now,
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-06.png	the bell would ring for them - the gilded
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-07.png	love house, the mad grandmother or the
data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-08.png	bloody child at the crossroads.
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-00.png	It was growing cold. We left the
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-01.png	crowd and drove back to Vence.
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-02.png	The cool evening perfumes stood

data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-04.png	Mart is unable to smell (her sense
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-05.png	organs were impaired years ago), and
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-06.png	I had to explain the low, sharp and
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-07.png	sweet signals in the air. When we
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-08.png	got back home we felt exhausted.
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-09.png	London sickness (a sense of guilt,
data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-10.png	mingled with the memory of sandwiches
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-00.png	We went straight to bed and slept until
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-01.png	the turtle-doves drummed up the
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-02.png	sun. The next morning, in the square
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-03.png	opposite Pierre's, I read about the Nice
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-04.png	beach catastrophe in the Patriote.
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-05.png	Mart had been right, the body had been
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-06.png	a woman's. It belonged to a Madame
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-07.png	N. Enquiries had been made in the
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-08.png	neighbourhood, and it transpired that
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-09.png	Madame N's husband had made an
data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-10.png	arrangement with the dead lady's sister
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-00.png	The sister, able to swim, had returned
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-01.png	to the shore, but instead of returning
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-02.png	to her brother-in-law (with whom
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-03.png	she had an illicit relationship), she
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-04.png	went to her fiance*?2's house and
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-05.png	confessed everything. Her fiance*?2
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-06.png	reported her to the police, and then jumped
data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-07.png	off a cliff near Monte Carlo.
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-00.png	The day I promised to take Catherine
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-01.png	down to visit my young friend Philip
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-02.png	at his school in the country, we were
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-03.png	to leave at eleven, but she arrived
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-04.png	at nine. Her blue dress was new,
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-05.png	and so were her fashionable shoes. Her
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-06.png	hair had just been done. She looked
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-07.png	more than ever like a pink and gold
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-08.png	Renoir girl who expects everything from
data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-09.png	life.
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-00.png	Catherine lives in a white house
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-01.png	overlooking the sweeping brown tides
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-02.png	of the river. She helped me clean up my
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-03.png	flat with a devotion which said that
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-04.png	she felt small flats were altogether more
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-05.png	romantic than large houses. We drank
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-06.png	tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-07.png	being 15, has pure stern tastes in every-
data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-08.png	thing from food to music.
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-00.png	Catherine looked at the books lying
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-01.png	around his room, and asked if she
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-02.png	might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-03.png	to read on the train. Catherine is 13.
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-04.png	I suggested she might find them dif-
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-05.png	ficult, but she said, 'Philip reads them,
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-06.png	doesn't he?' During the journey I read
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-07.png	newspapers and watched her pretty
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-08.png	frowning face as she turned the
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-09.png	pages of Babel, for she was determined
data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-10.png	to let nothing get between her and
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-00.png	At the school, which is charming, ci-
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-01.png	vilised and expensive, the two children
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-02.png	walked together across green fields, and
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-03.png	I followed, seeing how the sun gilded
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-04.png	their bright friendly heads turned
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-05.png	towards each other as they talked. In
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-06.png	Catherine's left hand she carried the
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-07.png	stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-08.png	went to the pictures. Philip allowed
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-09.png	# it to be seen that he thought going to
data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-10.png	the pictures just for the fun of it was
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-00.png	For his sake we chose the more
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-01.png	serious of the two films that were
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-02.png	showing in the little town. It was
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-03.png	about a good priest who helped cri-
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-04.png	minals in New York. His goodness, how-
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-05.png	ever, was not enough to prevent one
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-06.png	of them from being sent to the gas
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-07.png	chamber; and Philip and I waited with
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-08.png	Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-09.png	crying and could face the light of a golden
data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-10.png	evening.
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-00.png	At the entrance of the cinema the
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-01.png	doorman was lying in wait for anyone
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-02.png	who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-03.png	by her suffering arm, he said bitterly:
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-04.png	'Yes, why are you crying, he had to be
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-05.png	punished for his crime, didn't he?' Cathe-
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-06.png	rine stared at him, incredulous. Philip
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-07.png	rescued her by saying with disdain:
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-08.png	'Some people don't know right from wrong
data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-09.png	even when its demonstrated to them.'
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-00.png	The doorman turned his attention
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-01.png	to the next red-eyed emerger from the
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-02.png	dark; and we went on together to
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-03.png	the station, the children silent because
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-04.png	of the cruelty of the world. Finally Catherine
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-05.png	said, her eyes wet again: 'I think its all
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-06.png	absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-07.png	about it.' And Philip said: 'But we've got
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-08.png	to think about it, don't you see, because
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-09.png	if we don't it'll just go on and on, don't
data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-10.png	you see?'
