dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-00.png	Mr. Macleod went on with the conference
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-01.png	at Lancaster House despite the crisis
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-02.png	which had blown up. He has now revealed

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-04.png	attending. These plans do not give the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-05.png	Africans the overall majority they are
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-06.png	seeking. African delegates are studying
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-07.png	them today. The conference will meet
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020u/a01-020u-08.png	to discuss the function of a proposed

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-07.png	Party. But representatives of Sir Roy
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-08.png	Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-09.png	African Federation, went to Chequers at
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026u/a01-026u-10.png	the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-00.png	Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-01.png	Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-02.png	meeting. But he told M Ps yesterday: &quot;I
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-03.png	have no knowledge of secret negotiations.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-04.png	He said Britain had an obligation to consult
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-05.png	the Federal Government. But the final
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-06.png	decision remained with the British Government.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-07.png	Mr. James Callaghan, Labour's Colonial
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-08.png	spokesman, said Sir Roy had no right to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-09.png	delay progress in the talks by refusing
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-030u/a01-030u-10.png	to sit round the conference table.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-00.png	Informal talks at Lancaster House will

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-02.png	defended the appointment of a Negro as
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-03.png	his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-04.png	opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-05.png	Deep South. The negro is Mr. Robert #
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-06.png	Weaver of New York. One of his tasks will
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043u/a01-043u-07.png	be to see there is no racial discrimination

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-01.png	sparked off the opposition by telling a

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-03.png	Washington gossip&quot; that Weaver once had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-04.png	Communist affiliations. The Senate Banking

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049u/a01-049u-09.png	Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-05.png	is headed by another Southern Senator -
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-06.png	Willis Robertson, of Virginia - met today in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-07.png	closed session to discuss Weaver's appointment.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-08.png	Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-09.png	letter to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049x/a01-049x-10.png	complaints about Weaver's loyalty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-00.png	He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-01.png	alleged association with organisations black-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-02.png	listed by the Government. Immediately Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-03.png	Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-04.png	saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-05.png	reported on Mr. Weaver. He believed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-06.png	he would perform &quot;outstanding service&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-07.png	in his post. Senator Robertson's committee
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-08.png	has to pass Mr. Weaver's nomination before it
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-053u/a01-053u-09.png	can be considered by the full Senate.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-00.png	PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-01.png	over West Germany's cash offer to help
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-02.png	America's balance of payments position. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-03.png	said bluntly in Washington yesterday that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-04.png	the offer - 357million - was not good enough.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-05.png	And he indicated that his Government
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-06.png	would try to get Germany to pay more. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-07.png	did not mention personal talks with Dr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-058u/a01-058u-08.png	Adenauer, the West German Chancellor.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-00.png	But he said discussions &quot;on a higher
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-01.png	level than in the past&quot; might be useful.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-02.png	The President will probably discuss the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-03.png	problem with Dr. Brentano, the West German
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-04.png	Foreign Minister, who is due in Washington
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-05.png	next week. A big slice of Germany's &quot;aid&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-06.png	is the early payment of a 210million
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-07.png	debt to America. United States officials
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-08.png	quickly point out that this is money due
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-063u/a01-063u-09.png	to America anyway.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-00.png	And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-01.png	that they cannot pay more than 357million
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-02.png	without upsetting their own economy. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-03.png	Americans say Germany is having it too
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-04.png	good and is not paying for the past
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-05.png	or for the present. The Adenauer Government
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-06.png	flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-07.png	Government to get them to pay a regular
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-08.png	sum towards the cost of keeping American
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-068u/a01-068u-09.png	troops in Germany.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-00.png	These support costs are a big drain on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-01.png	America's dollar reserves. Dr. Adenauer's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-02.png	answer is the once-and-for-all cash
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-03.png	offer of 357 million. President Kennedy's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-04.png	rejection of it is a painful blow to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-05.png	West German Government. It will now have
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-06.png	to pay more - and increase taxation to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-07.png	so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-08.png	the new American administration.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-00.png	And, since this is election year in West
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-077u/a01-077u-01.png	Germany, Dr. Adenauer is in a tough spot.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-082u/a01-082u-09.png	in personality last night dominated
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-00.png	Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-01.png	led Labour's attack on the higher health
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-02.png	charges. Mr. Powell, white-faced and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-03.png	outwardly unemotional, replied with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-04.png	statistical statement - and ended by inciting
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-05.png	Labour M Ps to angry uproar. One dealt
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-06.png	with the human issue behind the Health
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-07.png	Service; the other tried to show that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087u/a01-087u-08.png	balance-sheet must always come first.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-00.png	The result of the vote was not in doubt.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-01.png	For the Tories were massed in answer to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-02.png	their whips to defeat a censure motion
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-03.png	on the Government for &quot;undermining the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-04.png	Health Service&quot; and placing heavy burdens
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-05.png	on those least able to bear them. Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-06.png	Brown declared that the policy under
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-07.png	censure was monstrous. It had offended
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-08.png	many people far beyond the ranks of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091u/a01-091u-09.png	Labour supporters.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-00.png	The Press, many doctors and public were
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-01.png	denouncing the proposals. He quoted from
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-02.png	this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received:
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-03.png	&quot;My background is a doctor of 68, who
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-04.png	has practised medicine for 43 years, chiefly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-05.png	as a panel doctor. &quot;I am a lifelong
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-06.png	Conservative. I am horrified and amazed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-07.png	by my party's proposal to prostitute the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-08.png	whole principle of the State service and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-09.png	to render that service a hardship to poor
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-10.png	people.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-00.png	&quot;After a lifetime of helping others and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-01.png	healing the sick, my considered opinion is that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-02.png	anybody supporting the increased charges is a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-03.png	wicked, old -.&quot; Mr. Brown went on: &quot;We
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-04.png	are dealing with a noble edifice which
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-05.png	needs an imaginative architect to improve
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-06.png	it, but it has got a quantity surveyor. We
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-07.png	have descended from the real problems to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102u/a01-102u-08.png	fiddling about with bills of cost.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-00.png	&quot;We believe that a comprehensive medical
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-01.png	service, free to the patient at the point
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-02.png	of need and with one standard for all
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-03.png	sick people, is good and attainable.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-04.png	&quot;We remain for it. But the Tories
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-05.png	never were.&quot; Interrupted by angry Tories,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-06.png	Mr. Brown retorted: &quot;The jackals bay
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107u/a01-107u-07.png	when there is nothing better they can do.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-00.png	He told them that their conception of social
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-01.png	services was wholly different - fundamentally
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-02.png	different from that of Labour. They would
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-03.png	provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-04.png	wretched - but it would not be too comfortable
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-05.png	nor too easy to get. Answering jeers that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-06.png	it was Labour which first put a ceiling
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-07.png	on health spending and started charges, Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-08.png	Brown reminded the hostile Government benches
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-09.png	that was done in 1950 because of the financial
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-10.png	strain of the Korean war.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-00.png	In fact, the Tories made it worse now
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-01.png	for the sick and needy than Labour had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-02.png	to make it in 1950. And as a percentage
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-03.png	of social service expenditure, health had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-04.png	fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-05.png	Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-06.png	the unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-07.png	that instead of taking it out of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-08.png	patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-09.png	action against the drug making industry, #
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117u/a01-117u-10.png	whose profits had risen by up to 400 per
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-00.png	&quot;Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-01.png	of mothers, children and sick people than
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-02.png	to take on this vast industry,&quot; Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-03.png	Brown commented icily. &quot;Let us have a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-04.png	full inquiry into the cost of drugs and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-05.png	the pharmaceutical industry.&quot; The health
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-06.png	of children today owed much to the welfare
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-07.png	food scheme. It was maintained during
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-08.png	the war. Now in conditions of Tory
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-09.png	affluence it seemed it could not be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122u/a01-122u-10.png	carried on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-00.png	When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-01.png	cheered for a full minute - and even his
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-02.png	bitterest opponents on defence joined in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-03.png	Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-04.png	details of plans for improving the hospital
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-05.png	service, on which indeed the Government is
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-06.png	making progress. His basic defence of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-07.png	Health Service cuts was that &quot;even after
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-08.png	the proposed changes the net cost of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-09.png	service to the Exchequer will have increased
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-10.png	over three years by 20 per cent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-00.png	&quot;That cannot continue without either development
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-01.png	being limited or an adjustment being made
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-02.png	in financing.&quot; The Government decided to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-03.png	adjust the financing - which Mr. Powell
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-04.png	claimed was underpinning - not undermining -
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-05.png	the service. Answering the attack on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-06.png	&quot;economic charges&quot; for welfare foods, Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-07.png	Powell said that all these foods would
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-08.png	still be free in families receiving regular
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-09.png	National Assistance grants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-00.png	&quot;That cannot continue without either development
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-01.png	being limited or an adjustment being made
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-02.png	in financing.&quot; The Government decided to adjust
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-03.png	the financing - which Mr. Powell claimed was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-04.png	underpinning - not undermining - the service.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-05.png	Answering the attack on &quot;economic charges&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-06.png	for welfare, Mr. Powell said that all these
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-07.png	foods would still be free in families receiving
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132x/a01-132x-08.png	regular National Assistance grants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-00.png	On the other hand, Mr. Pearson excels
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-01.png	in meeting people informally, but many
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-02.png	still regard him &quot;as some sort of cross
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-03.png	between an egghead and a missionary&quot;.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-04.png	His party advisers are now trying to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-05.png	correct that image. The bow tie has
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-06.png	gone; he is having lessons on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-07.png	television techniques and is being coached
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-050/a03-050-08.png	by speech experts.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-00.png	But, at the same time, there is reason to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-01.png	believe that the Federal Government is not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-02.png	convinced, on the basis of the information
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-03.png	it has so far, that such a project would
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-04.png	be justified from a scientific point of view;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-05.png	and not merely constitute a &quot;prestige&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-06.png	satellite, duplicating to some extent American
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-07.png	efforts, as Die Welt suggests today in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-071/a03-071-08.png	a highly critical editorial article.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-00.png	On the specific question of the use of Blue
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-01.png	Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-02.png	easier. He can point out that this is the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-03.png	only rocket and launcher in Europe to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-04.png	have reached a sufficient stage of development
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-05.png	for adaptation as the first stage in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-06.png	putting a heavy satellite into outer space.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-07.png	There has also been some talk of adopting another
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-08.png	British rocket, Black Knight, for the second
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-09.png	stage, but the French have one of their
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-10.png	own called Veronique which they would
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-073/a03-073-11.png	like to see used.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-00.png	The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-01.png	today, however, that the Brussels Treaty
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-02.png	was irrelevant, because research on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-03.png	various rocket stages had already been
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-04.png	concluded, and only cooperation on the type
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-05.png	of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-06.png	to German participation is the absence of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-07.png	any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-08.png	for it - and therefore of any budget
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-080/a03-080-09.png	under which funds could be appropriated.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-00.png	This is expected eventually to replace the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-01.png	Fiat G-91, and the F 104 Starfighter,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-02.png	the backbone of the German Air
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-089/a03-089-03.png	Force.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-00.png	THE next White Paper on defence, to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-01.png	be published in March, is likely to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-02.png	contain a five-year plan for the three
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-03.png	Services. Its aim will be to produce superbly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-04.png	equipped, all-Regular forces of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-05.png	about 400,000 men. The three Services
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-06.png	would be &quot;integrated&quot; to a greater
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-000/a05-000-07.png	extent than ever before.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-00.png	The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-01.png	approval. Mr. Watkinson remains con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-02.png	vinced that the policy initiated in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-03.png	1957, in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-04.png	of Defence, is still correct. This was to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-05.png	return to the tradition of all-Regular
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-06.png	voluntary forces, with the last National
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-07.png	Serviceman out of uniform by the end
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-013/a05-013-08.png	of 1962.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-00.png	The Minister regards the recent trend
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-01.png	of recruiting figures as encouraging.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-02.png	He is confident the aim can be achieved.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-03.png	While the possibility of an eventual return

dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-05.png	cannot be entirely discounted, he does
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-06.png	not agree that the point has been reached
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-07.png	where this need even be considered. If
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-08.png	National Service is ever resorted to,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-09.png	engagement would probably have to be for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-017/a05-017-10.png	three years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-00.png	It is thought this would be the minimum
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-01.png	necessary for the extended training modern
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-02.png	arms require and to enable each man to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-03.png	serve at least a year overseas. There is
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-04.png	no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-05.png	is at odds with the Service chiefs over
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-06.png	the decision to dispense with National
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-07.png	Service, or over any other aspect of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-022/a05-022-08.png	defence policy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-00.png	Criticisms about Army manpower appear
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-01.png	to have come mainly from retired officers
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-02.png	who have held high positions but
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-03.png	are out of touch with the existing situation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-04.png	Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-05.png	from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-06.png	Francis Festing, who believes completely
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-07.png	in the principle of an all-Regular army.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-08.png	Gen. Sir Richard Hull, who is to succeed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-09.png	Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-025/a05-025-10.png	Watkinson is right.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-00.png	Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-01.png	as from Nov. 1. The hand-over, due in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-02.png	September, was delayed because of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-03.png	Berlin crisis. Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-04.png	felt the change would be unwise at a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-05.png	moment # when attention had to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-06.png	concentrated on possible need for important
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-07.png	military operations. For this reason Sir
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-08.png	Francis stayed on, and # sacrificed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-029/a05-029-09.png	his leave.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-00.png	There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-01.png	towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-02.png	the Prime Minister. This implies the dis-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-03.png	appearance of the Progressive party from
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-04.png	the House. Early results in yesterday's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-05.png	general election showed Nationalists being
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-06.png	returned in their strongholds, like Bloem-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-07.png	fontein and the Transvaal, with slightly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-08.png	increased majorities. In the Cape, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-09.png	veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-039/a05-039-10.png	Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-00.png	The defeat of the leader of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-01.png	Progressive party, Dr. Steytler, in Port
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-02.png	Elizabeth South, announced immediately
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-03.png	afterwards by the United party candidate,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-04.png	Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives deprived
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-044/a05-044-05.png	of both their chief figures. Dr. Verwoerd and

dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-00.png	Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-01.png	evident that voters were bored by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-02.png	Government's frequent appeals to the electorate.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-03.png	The election was the fourth in four years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-04.png	In most constituencies it may go down as
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-05.png	the most apathetic in the country's history.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-06.png	THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-07.png	last night that he had considered early
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-08.png	in the Parliamentary recess whether to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-09.png	mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-048/a05-048-10.png	British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-00.png	He decided that it would be a great error
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-01.png	to do so and to recall Parliament. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-02.png	there would be no hesitation in mobilising
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-03.png	if a further deterioration in the situation
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-04.png	warranted such a step. It would have to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-05.png	accompanied by other measures of a military,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-06.png	economic and political kind. Mr. Macmillan,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-07.png	who was winding up the foreign affairs
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-08.png	debate, said the Government could not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-09.png	be party to accepting as a matter of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-053/a05-053-10.png	principle the imposed division of Germany.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-00.png	&quot;We must not be rattled into surrender,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-01.png	but we must not - and I am not - be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-02.png	afraid of negotiation.&quot; Mr. Godber,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-03.png	Minister of State, Foreign Office, said
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-04.png	earlier that the Government had asked
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-05.png	the Medical Research Council to reassess
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-06.png	the fall-out position in view of the Russian
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-07.png	tests. The Council's findings would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-058/a05-058-08.png	made public.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-00.png	With a vigour and authority which delighted
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-01.png	old Parliamentary friends and foes alike,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-02.png	the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-03.png	Eden, in his maiden speech in the House
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-04.png	of Lords last night, gave a warning
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-05.png	that # appeasement over Berlin could
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-06.png	only lead to war. To stand firm, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-07.png	declared, was not to invite war, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-062/a05-062-08.png	the surest way to avert it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-00.png	It was the end of a rather curious
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-01.png	speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-02.png	the two-day debate on foreign affairs.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-03.png	He began in a low, almost chatty mono-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-04.png	tone, and his voice never rose to any
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-05.png	accent of urgency. He passed in rapid
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-06.png	review the United Nations Secretariat;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-07.png	nuclear tests; the canard about British
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-08.png	interference with the United Nations
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-09.png	in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-069/a05-069-10.png	Asia.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-00.png	He spent most of his short half-hour on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-01.png	Berlin. He deplored the possibility of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-02.png	some &quot;new myth&quot; about betrayal of Germany
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-03.png	by the Allies. &quot;We do not,&quot; he said, &quot;really
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-04.png	know what the Russians want.&quot; But he was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-05.png	certain that they wanted to establish a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-06.png	final and irrevocable division of Germany.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-07.png	Britain could not be a party to an imposed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-08.png	division. But negotiation, as the debate had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-09.png	shown, could be undertaken on a variety
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-073/a05-073-10.png	of bases.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-00.png	Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-01.png	ately refrained during the summer from
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-02.png	recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-03.png	by proclamation, such as would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-04.png	necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-05.png	on to a fully active footing. That
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-06.png	would have created a thoroughly unde-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-07.png	sirable atmosphere of panic. He thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-08.png	that the situation was rather more
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-080/a05-080-09.png	hopeful.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-00.png	The Russians now realised its seriousness. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-01.png	French doubts were more about procedure
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-02.png	than about substance. The Prime Minister's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-03.png	attitude of studied calm brought down the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-04.png	temperature of the debate, which never
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-05.png	at any time rose to fever pitch, to a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-06.png	remarkable degree of sub-normality.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-07.png	Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-08.png	of Home, Foreign Secretary, was listening
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-084/a05-084-09.png	in the Peers' Gallery.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-00.png	The early speakers in the debate each
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-01.png	severely rated the speech of his predecessor.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-02.png	These strictures were all too well justified.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-03.png	We started with the plaintive wailings
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-04.png	of Mr. Healey, &quot;Shadow&quot; Foreign Secretary,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-05.png	described by Mr. Godber, Minister of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-06.png	State, Foreign Office, as &quot;pedantic and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-07.png	obscure on Berlin, damaging and obscure
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-08.png	on the Congo.&quot; In turn, Mr. Godber was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-09.png	censured by Mr. Shinwell, former Labour
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-089/a05-089-10.png	Defence Minister, for having read the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-00.png	The trouble about such debates is that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-01.png	they range too widely. They remind one of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-02.png	the Rugby match in &quot;Tom Brown's Schooldays,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-03.png	in which all the boys were welcome to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-04.png	take part, and only those who &quot;really meant
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-05.png	business&quot; removed their jackets. Not many
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-06.png	metaphorical braces were visible in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-07.png	early stages of to-night's debate. Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-08.png	Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-09.png	golf-course Press conference, which he
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-094/a05-094-10.png	described as &quot;a display of flabby and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-00.png	A reference to the reunification of Germany
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-01.png	brought a bark of &quot;Start another war!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-02.png	from Mr. Ellis Smith (Lab., Stoke on Trent S.).
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-03.png	Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-04.png	theme of limitation of armaments in Europe.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-05.png	This could, he suggested, be linked with
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-06.png	prohibition of the production of atomic
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-07.png	weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-08.png	and control would be much easier to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-099/a05-099-09.png	establish in these territories.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-00.png	Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-01.png	using double standards. Ministers had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-02.png	rebuked the unaligned nations for not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-03.png	condemning the new Russian tests, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-04.png	they themselves had no condemnation for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-05.png	events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-06.png	the Government, said Mr. Healey, to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-07.png	take up moral attitudes, &quot;especially when
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-104/a05-104-08.png	the temple of their religion is the

dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-00.png	True, he did tell the House that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-01.png	Government had asked the Medical Research

dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-113/a05-113-05.png	He was not so happy in his defence of

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-04.png	&quot;undermining the Health Service&quot; and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-05.png	placing heavy burdens on those least
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-06.png	able to bear them. Mr. Brown

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-091/a01-091-10.png	supporters.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-00.png	&quot;After a lifetime of helping others and

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-02.png	opinion is that anybody supporting
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-03.png	the increased charges is a wicked,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-04.png	old -.&quot; Mr. Brown went on: &quot;We
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-05.png	are dealing with a noble edifice which
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-06.png	needs an imaginative architect to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-07.png	improve it, but it has got a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-08.png	quantity surveyor. We have descended
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-09.png	from the real problems to fiddling about
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-102/a01-102-10.png	with bills of cost.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-00.png	Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted, led
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-01.png	Labour's attack on the higher health
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-02.png	charges. Mr. Powell, white-faced and outwardly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-03.png	unemotional, replied with a statistical state-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-04.png	ment - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-05.png	to angry uproar. One dealt with the human
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-06.png	issue behind the Health Service; the other
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-07.png	tried to show that the balance-sheet must
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-087/a01-087-08.png	always come first.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-00.png	A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine, paid

dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-02.png	Those who lend their names to this kind of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-03.png	advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-04.png	of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-05.png	idea that moral regeneration would solve
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-06.png	all our problems. So it would. While we are
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-07.png	waiting for the millenium, however, most of us
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-08.png	would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-09.png	instruments of democracy, such as trade unions
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-057/b01-057-10.png	and our local and national Parliaments.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-00.png	Should the Herald publish such advertisements?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-01.png	This is a difficult question. It would obviously
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-02.png	be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-03.png	which we disagree. When an advertisement
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-04.png	contains statements whose factual truth is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-05.png	doubtful, or where the total content would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-06.png	deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-07.png	exercise editorial discretion. The MRA
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-08.png	advertisement falls into neither category, though
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-062/b01-062-09.png	many readers will dislike it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107/a01-107-00.png	We believe that a comprehensive medical service, free to the patient
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107/a01-107-01.png	at the point of need and with one standard for all sick
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107/a01-107-02.png	people, is good and attainable. &quot;We remain for it. But the Tories
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107/a01-107-03.png	never were.&quot; Interrupted by angry Tories, Mr. Brown retorted:
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-107/a01-107-04.png	&quot;The jackals bay when there is nothing better they can do.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-00.png	He told them that their conception of social services was wholly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-01.png	different - fundamentally different from that of Labour. They
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-02.png	would provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-03.png	wretched - but it would not be too comfortable nor too easy to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-04.png	get. Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-05.png	ceiling on health spending and started charges, Mr. Brown
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-06.png	reminded the hostile Government benches that was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-07.png	done in 1950 because of the financial strain of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-113/a01-113-08.png	the Korean war.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-00.png	In fact, the Tories made it worse now for the sick and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-01.png	needy than Labour had to make it in 1950. And
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-02.png	as a percentage of social service expenditure,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-03.png	health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-04.png	Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-05.png	unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded that instead
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-06.png	of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-07.png	take ruthless action against the drug making
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-08.png	industry, whose profits had risen by up to 400
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-117/a01-117-09.png	per cent. in the last eight years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-00.png	&quot;Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out of mothers,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-01.png	children and sick people than to take on this vast
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-02.png	industry,&quot; Mr. Brown commented icily. &quot;Let us have a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-03.png	full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the pharmaceutical
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-04.png	industry.&quot; The health of children today owed much
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-05.png	to the welfare food scheme. It was maintained
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-06.png	during the war. Now in conditions of Tory
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-122/a01-122-07.png	affluence it seemed it could not be carried on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-00.png	When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-01.png	a full minute - and even his bitterest opponents
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-02.png	on defence joined in. Mr. Powell devoted half his speech
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-03.png	to giving details of plans for improving the hospital service,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-04.png	on which indeed the Government is making progress.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-05.png	His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-06.png	&quot;even after the proposed changes the net cost of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-07.png	service to the Exchequer will have increased over
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-128/a01-128-08.png	three years by 20 per cent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-00.png	MR. Macmillan has picked a strong &quot;brains trust&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-01.png	team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-02.png	And he has abandoned plans to visit President de
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-03.png	Gaulle this month to smooth the way. General
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-04.png	de Gaulle's official welcome last week
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-05.png	to Britain's moves towards the Six was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-06.png	taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-000/a02-000-07.png	but no more than that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-004/a02-004-00.png	So the idea of personal mission by

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-02.png	in touch in London. Three of them - Canada, Australia,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-03.png	New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-06.png	for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-008/a02-008-07.png	countries can arrange for observers to advise the British

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-012/a02-012-09.png	is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-00.png	Other leading members are: Sir Henry Lintott from

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-04.png	They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-05.png	he goes to Brussels, headquarters of the Common

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-017/a02-017-07.png	negotiations should be held.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-00.png	Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-01.png	meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville, French
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-02.png	Foreign Minister, and Mr. Heath. MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-03.png	a man with troubles enough back home - seems
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-04.png	fated to fly into trouble abroad. Last year it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-05.png	the riots in Istanbul, which enlivened the NATO
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-020/a02-020-06.png	Council meeting.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-00.png	Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-01.png	Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-02.png	monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-03.png	first to be held in Africa. Only a few hours af-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-04.png	ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-05.png	at Accra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-06.png	demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-024/a02-024-07.png	Stores, the largest in town.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-00.png	The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-01.png	that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-02.png	week. Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-03.png	including a compulsory savings scheme which the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-04.png	Ghana Government introduced in July. Ghana's strong
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-05.png	man is not here to face the storm. President Nkrumah,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-06.png	having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-07.png	in Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-08.png	Sea and no one here professes to know when he
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-027/a02-027-09.png	will return.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-00.png	But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-01.png	not let him down. The strong arm of authority has
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-02.png	been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-03.png	to tell. Today's Ghanaian Times (motto: &quot;The welfare
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-04.png	of the people is the supreme law&quot;) reports: &quot;The
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-05.png	Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-032/a02-032-06.png	tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-00.png	The urge came from a conference of activists of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-01.png	Nkrumah's Convention Party &quot;after powerful addresses
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-02.png	by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio,&quot; and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-03.png	others. Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-04.png	a &quot;limited state of emergency&quot; was declared, giving
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-05.png	the Government adequate power to maintain all
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-06.png	essential services and ensure food supplies. Thus it
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-07.png	becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-08.png	for anyone who &quot;publishes a report likely to cause
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-037/a02-037-09.png	alarm or prejudicial to public safety.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-00.png	And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-01.png	on anyone convicted of sabotage. These stern measures
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-02.png	had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-03.png	strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-04.png	they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-05.png	police and 16 armoured cars. And how did the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-06.png	Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-042/a02-042-07.png	Accra?
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-00.png	&quot;It is true he made a point of again being absent
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-01.png	from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-02.png	indulged in such violence.&quot; But Sir Roy pointed out
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-03.png	that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-04.png	if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-090/a02-090-05.png	would make the Mau Mau in Kenya &quot;seem like a

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-00.png	Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-01.png	problem. Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-02.png	strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-03.png	suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-04.png	African nationalists. Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-05.png	from talks with Sir John Moffat, Northern Rhodesian
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-06.png	Liberal leader, and Mr. Kaunda, that the bulk
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-07.png	of moderates and Africans will reject the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-098/a02-098-08.png	Constitution unless it is modified.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-02.png	drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-03.png	demonstrators, most of them shopgirls in overalls.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-04.png	&quot;If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock,&quot; he
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-05.png	told them, 'the police will act.' At five to ten
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-06.png	a posse of police arrived and in less than
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-046/a02-046-07.png	two minutes the crowd had gone.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-050/a02-050-04.png	After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-00.png	It alleged: Phones were being tapped and

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-06.png	that anti-apartheid agitation was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-07.png	all right, but support for the committee
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-057/a02-057-08.png	was not.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-00.png	They are required to show why they

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-02.png	the peace and for inciting a breach
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-03.png	of the peace. The summonses say they
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-04.png	are &quot;likely to persevere in such unlawful
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-067/a02-067-05.png	conduct.&quot; Lord Russell, 89, was

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-00.png	&quot;He is not going to agree to be bound over. That will
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-01.png	probably mean jail and, though frail, he is very fit and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-02.png	will take the rigours of prison in his stride. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-03.png	hopes to be allowed to do some writing.&quot; Back at

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-05.png	members tried a &quot;plant&quot; call on suspect phone. They
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-072/a02-072-06.png	discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-00.png	Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-08.png	back a long way, Sir Roy told the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-078/a02-078-09.png	Federal Parliament in Salisbury.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-00.png	He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-01.png	had been arrested or convicted since last year on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-02.png	charges of creating disturbances. During the first
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-03.png	three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-04.png	had been reported in Northern Rhodesia. More
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-05.png	than 500 people - 167 of them members of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-082/a02-082-06.png	the UNIP - were convicted last month in the

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-00.png	&quot;Against this background must be taken Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-01.png	Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-02.png	doing is in the name of non-violence,&quot; said
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-03.png	Sir Roy. &quot;I am now compelled to say that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-04.png	I don't accept his good faith.&quot; He said
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-05.png	Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-06.png	had stimulated violence, but he had done
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-086/a02-086-07.png	nothing to stop it.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-04.png	The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-05.png	The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-06.png	to settle the relationships between them and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-07.png	rest of the country. A Government report has
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-08.png	recognised their rights and recommended a form of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-106/a02-106-09.png	federal association, but the four kings are not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-00.png	Instead, the kings will remain in London
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-01.png	and wait to hear the conference's proposals.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-02.png	Then their views will be transmitted back.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-03.png	MR. BUTLER, the Home Secretary, has decided
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-04.png	to meet head-on the biggest challenge to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-05.png	Government authority yet presented by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-06.png	&quot;Ban-the-Bomb&quot; demonstrators. Police leave
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-07.png	has been cancelled and secret plans prepared
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-08.png	to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-09.png	for Sunday in Parliament-square by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-10.png	Committee of 100, the anti-nuclear arms
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-111/a02-111-11.png	group.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-00.png	Measures agreed so far include: 1. A mass
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-01.png	call-out of police, special constables
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-02.png	and reserves, with 750 policemen posted
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-03.png	from outlying districts to stations in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-04.png	the area - West End Central, Bow-street,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-124/a02-124-05.png	and Cannon-row.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-00.png	It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-01.png	in the role of a popular orator at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-02.png	hustings, the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-03.png	baker was in the last two campaigns. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-04.png	impression remains that the Liberal leader
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-05.png	is still the diplomatist, more at home
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-06.png	in the chancery, or the corridors of the United
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-07.png	Nations, not the father figure, so necessary
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-047/a03-047-08.png	in Canadian leadership, or the practical

dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-00.png	It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-01.png	ended yesterday in 32 members of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-02.png	Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-03.png	a breach of the peace. The committee's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-04.png	president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-05.png	his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-06.png	a week. Playwrights Arnold Wesker (The Kitchen)
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-07.png	and Robert Bolt (The Flowering Cherry) were
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-116/a02-116-08.png	jailed for a month.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-00.png	The possibility that the Government might
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-01.png	invoke the Public Order Act, 1936, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-02.png	declare the whole rally illegal - whether
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-03.png	the demonstrators sit down or not - was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-04.png	being discussed in Whitehall last night.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-05.png	It was last used a year ago, to deal
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-06.png	with the St. Pancras rent riots. Today
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-07.png	Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-08.png	Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-09.png	draw up final plans for the "Battle
dataset/iam_lines/data/a02/a02-120/a02-120-10.png	of Parliament Square."
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-00.png	Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of Indo-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-01.png	nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-02.png	Foreign Minister. In fact such Yugoslav activity has
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-03.png	been # particularly intensified in the past year
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-04.png	or so and though so far, apart from joint action
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-05.png	in the United Nations, these exchanges have not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-06.png	been seen on any wider basis, President Tito
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-07.png	is known for some time to have favoured a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-006/a03-006-08.png	conference of neutralist leaders.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-00.png	The wish was particularly apparent in comments
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-01.png	on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-02.png	in particular, in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-03.png	inter-African consultative assembly which would
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-04.png	coordinate activity on the political and economic
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-05.png	sphere; and it is not difficult to see that President
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-06.png	Tito would like some such idea extended also
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-009/a03-009-07.png	to the whole uncommitted world
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-00.png	But he now feels, in view of a changed international
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-01.png	situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-02.png	the new and independent countries of Africa, that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-03.png	time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-04.png	the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-05.png	stands on various problems facing those nations. Two
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-06.png	subjects, the Congo and Algeria, are the main topics
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-07.png	of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-011/a03-011-08.png	leaders have identical ideas.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-00.png	Two emissaries from the Laotian Government
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-01.png	of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-02.png	Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to invite Prince

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-04.png	ister, to return to Laos. No details of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-05.png	their mission have been disclosed, but it
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-06.png	was reported earlier in Laos that Prince
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-07.png	Boun Oum was considering asking
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-08.png	Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-014/a03-014-09.png	Government.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-00.png	Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-01.png	the mission, but recent statements made by him
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-02.png	in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-03.png	himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-04.png	Laos. His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-05.png	to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace, though
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-06.png	at the cost of virtual partition of the country
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-07.png	into the pro-communist north and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-017/a03-017-08.png	pro-western centre and south.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-02.png	claims to be his representative in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-03.png	Laos, yesterday addressed all officers
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-04.png	of the pro-communist forces
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-05.png	occupying the province of Xieng
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-06.png	Khouang and emphasized that

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-020/a03-020-10.png	in the same terms.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-00.png	This emphasis on the legality of the former
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-01.png	Government suggests that all is not well
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-02.png	with the political and military leadership
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-03.png	of the pro-communists. Most of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-04.png	province of Xieng Khouang and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-05.png	tactically useful Plain of Jars, however,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-06.png	appear still to be firmly in their hands.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-07.png	The Government has claimed the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-023/a03-023-08.png	recapture of Vang Vieng, the pro-

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-07.png	some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since 1958
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-08.png	when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-027/a03-027-09.png	leader.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-00.png	In some ways it will be a testing occasion
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-01.png	for him, although some think his position
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-02.png	unassailable simply because there is no one
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-03.png	else in sight to supplant him. So the con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-04.png	ference will concentrate on laying the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-05.png	foundations on which to win the next
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-06.png	election. The rally comes at a time
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-07.png	when in spite of carefully worded state-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-08.png	ments by the Prime Minister there is an
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-030/a03-030-09.png	air of electoral expectancy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-00.png	Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-01.png	a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-02.png	which outlines in some detail the accomplishments

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-04.png	a half years ago. Nevertheless there is little
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-034/a03-034-05.png	illusion in the Conservative Party that their

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-03.png	fared badly. They are now faced with four other by-

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-037/a03-037-05.png	one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-01.png	Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-043/a03-043-02.png	popularity as an individual leader (for

dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-00.png	PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-01.png	on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-02.png	Common Market during their talks at Admiralty
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-03.png	House, Whitehall, yesterday. Much of their
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-04.png	three hours, 20 minutes of discussion is believed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-05.png	to have been devoted to this main point
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-000/a04-000-06.png	of American policy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-00.png	It arose during talks following
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-01.png	President Kennedy's report to the British
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-02.png	Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-03.png	visit to Paris. There General de Gaulle had made
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-04.png	clear that he would accept Britain into the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-05.png	Common Market only if there were no conditions
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-06.png	laid down to meet the Commonwealth
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-003/a04-003-07.png	and other reservations.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-00.png	Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-01.png	wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-02.png	Market, even if it meant an unconditional surrender.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-03.png	There were also brief discussions on Laos, Berlin
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-04.png	and other foreign questions, after Mr. Kennedy had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-05.png	informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-06.png	Krushchov. With the exception of 40 minutes when
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-07.png	Lord Home, Foreign Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-08.png	Bundy, the President's special assistant for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-09.png	security affairs, were brought in, the two
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-006/a04-006-10.png	men talked alone.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-00.png	An attempt to get more information about the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-01.png	Admiralty House meeting will be made in the

dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-03.png	have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-04.png	for a statement. President Kennedy flew from London
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-05.png	Airport last night to arrive in Washington this
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-06.png	morning. He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-07.png	broadcast and television report on his
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-010/a04-010-08.png	talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-00.png	The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-01.png	third talks - the first were at Key West, Florida, the second in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-02.png	Washington - said: &quot;Their discussions covered the major problems,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-03.png	both economic and political, and revealed once again the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-04.png	close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-05.png	common purposes. &quot;Occasion was given to review the need for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-06.png	economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-015/a04-015-07.png	of developed and underdeveloped countries alike.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-00.png	It said that the President and Premier noted &quot;with satisfaction&quot; the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-01.png	agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-02.png	which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-03.png	Geneva conference. &quot;Particular attention was also given to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-04.png	nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament. &quot;The
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-05.png	situation in regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was full
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-06.png	agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-019/a04-019-07.png	obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-00.png	Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-01.png	given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-02.png	guests present, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-03.png	times yesterday. In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-04.png	State, gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-05.png	15-nation Nato council. Some of his listeners said he was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-023/a04-023-06.png	&quot;rather pessimistic&quot; and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-00.png	From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-01.png	and informed him of the Vienna outcome. Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-02.png	in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-03.png	fly home with the President. In DUESSELDORF, Chancellor Adenauer
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-04.png	said the Vienna talks &quot;might be the beginning of a slight improvement,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-027/a04-027-05.png	but no big changes should be expected in the political situation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-00.png	Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-01.png	of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-02.png	sure the Labour movement was coming round in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-03.png	support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-04.png	widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-05.png	Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-06.png	supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-07.png	their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-047/a04-047-08.png	to the missile.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-00.png	Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-01.png	not deny facilities to nations to which it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-02.png	allied. But governments should be free to negotiate
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-03.png	and refuse proposals with which they did not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-04.png	agree. The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-05.png	he said, they were out of date and vulnerable and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-050/a04-050-06.png	would attract enemy action.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-00.png	That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-01.png	So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-02.png	the West, somewhere, must have them too. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-03.png	was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-04.png	purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-05.png	This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-054/a04-054-06.png	to oppose the Polaris depot ship.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-00.png	The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-01.png	in the Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-02.png	city with two million people. It should be sited
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-03.png	in a more remote area. Mr. Gaitskell added that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-04.png	the Scarborough conference decisions did not, in his
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-05.png	view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-06.png	of party members and still less the party's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-059/a04-059-07.png	supporters in the country.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-00.png	Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-01.png	unilateralists was not possible, though
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-02.png	he respected their views. He saw by reports
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-03.png	that &quot;those who organise these things&quot; were
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-04.png	recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-05.png	disarmament to shift the emphasis of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-06.png	their intervention away from straight opposition
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-07.png	to the official document on to opposition
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-066/a04-066-08.png	to the Polaris base.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-00.png	To Mr. Macmillan, Mr Gaitskell said the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-01.png	Prime Minister should begin to take
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-02.png	seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-03.png	weapons within the Nato alliance. &quot;Let us say
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-04.png	to Macmillan that he should press, I hope
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-05.png	with the agreement of Kennedy, in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-06.png	talks with the Soviet Union, for the establishment
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-07.png	in central Europe of a zone of controlled
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-069/a04-069-08.png	disarmament.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-00.png	He thought, he said, that the Soviet
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-01.png	Union would be prepared to reach
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-02.png	an agreement on a zone of controlled
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-03.png	disarmament in Europe. Mr Gaitskell
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-04.png	concluded, declaring that the present
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-05.png	was the beginning of a great period of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-06.png	opportunity for the party. It was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-07.png	great chance that should be grasped.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-08.png	Inter-union jealousies prevent the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-09.png	fulfilment of a common policy for wages
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-072/a04-072-10.png	and other major questions, Mr. Jack Cooper
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-00.png	The General Council of the Trades Union
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-01.png	Congress should therefore consider the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-02.png	matter. Consideration should also be given
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-03.png	to the regrouping of unions and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-04.png	modification of their structures to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-05.png	meet the growing concentration of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-06.png	capital. Mr. Cooper argued that a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-07.png	common industrial contribution was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-08.png	urgent - particularly in unions serving
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-081/a04-081-09.png	workers in the same industry - along
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-00.png	Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-01.png	membership of eight million was a &quot;poor
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-02.png	show&quot; compared with some countries, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-03.png	argued that the position needed examination.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-04.png	BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-05.png	Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-06.png	the views of a wide section of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-07.png	British people about Polaris submarine
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-08.png	bases in this country. An open letter
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-085/a04-085-09.png	written by Earl Russell hoping that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-00.png	Earl Russell, President of the Committee
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-01.png	of 100, told Kennedy that he should
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-02.png	take notice of &quot;that very large and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-03.png	growing section which is opposed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-04.png	the establishment of a Polaris base,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-05.png	whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-06.png	British territory.&quot; He pointed out that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-07.png	already there have been protests but
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-08.png	that &quot;very much larger protests are to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-089/a04-089-09.png	be expected and are being planned.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-00.png	There are three kinds of reasons that justify
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-01.png	the protests and these should carry weight with
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-02.png	the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. &quot;The
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-03.png	first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-04.png	serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-05.png	U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-06.png	circles, but in public opinion.&quot; Earl Russell
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-07.png	says it is inevitable, though profoundly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-08.png	regrettable, that the agitation against
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-09.png	the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-092/a04-092-10.png	to the policy of the United States.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-00.png	The second reason is concerned with doubts
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-01.png	as to the safety of the people of Great Britain;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-02.png	&quot;in the time of crisis it would probably be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-03.png	impossible for the British authorities to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-04.png	exercise any degree of control over the action
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-05.png	of Polaris submarines.&quot; He argues that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-06.png	there is a distinct possibility that so long
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-07.png	as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-08.png	Soviet Union might retaliate against
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-096/a04-096-09.png	Britain alone.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-00.png	&quot;Such retaliation might, and probably would,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-01.png	destroy the whole population of Britain in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-02.png	the course of, at the most, an hour&quot; without
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-03.png	provoking American retaliation. Earl Russell
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-04.png	believes: &quot;It is very questionable whether
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-05.png	British membership of Nato and British
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-06.png	permission of American bases on our territory
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-07.png	add anything to the strength of America,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-08.png	while, on the contrary, they impose upon
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-09.png	America an onerous obligation which it
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-099/a04-099-10.png	may prove impossible to fulfil.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-00.png	The third reason is that the supreme
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-01.png	interest for the whole world - East and
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-02.png	West and uncommitted nations - is the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-03.png	prevention of nuclear war. &quot;A rapidly
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-04.png	growing body of opinion in this country
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-05.png	believes that Britain could be more effective
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-06.png	in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-07.png	by helping to suggest agreements which could
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-103/a04-103-08.png	be accepted by both East and West.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-00.png	Short of wearing the same uniform, which is
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-01.png	not contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-02.png	Air Force would become, for practical purposes,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-03.png	a single defence force. There would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-04.png	complete co-operation at all levels in training
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-05.png	and operations. This would apply also in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-06.png	command structure and central administrative
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-07.png	organisation. Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-08.png	has been working on the plan for some months,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-004/a05-004-09.png	with the Prime Minister's approval.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-00.png	He has had numerous meetings with the Service
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-01.png	Ministers. He has also had talks with the Earl
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-02.png	of Home, Foreign Secretary, and with other
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-03.png	Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-04.png	of defence policy. Details of the scheme
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-05.png	are now being worked out by the Chiefs
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-06.png	of Staff, a process that may take four
dataset/iam_lines/data/a05/a05-009/a05-009-07.png	or five months.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-00.png	MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-01.png	to catch speculators in shares and property.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-02.png	The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-03.png	public opinion over his "July Budget" came
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-04.png	dramatically in the Commons yesterday. Mr
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-05.png	Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-06.png	to deal in his next regular Budget with
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-000/a06-000-07.png	some profits which now escape tax.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-00.png	Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-01.png	to the Treasury, said yesterday that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-02.png	Government does not like retrospective legislation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-03.png	He went on to describe the kind of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-04.png	people the Chancellor hopes to tax. These
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-05.png	are people buying and selling shares within
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-06.png	a short period, those &quot;stagging&quot; on a new issue
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-07.png	and property dealers who form a chain of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-08.png	companies and put one property deal through
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-004/a06-004-09.png	each.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-00.png	Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-01.png	offer the Government an easy passage for such
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-02.png	legislation. &quot;Why don't you make proposals to legislate
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-03.png	in the autumn?&quot; Mr. Wilson asked. &quot;We wouldn't call
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-04.png	it an Autumn Budget. You can call it a Taxation
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-05.png	Management Bill, if you like.&quot; While Mr. Wilson
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-06.png	was speaking, the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-008/a06-008-07.png	had a whispered conversation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-00.png	He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-01.png	ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said: &quot;Our rules
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-02.png	say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-03.png	for three years. &quot;I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-04.png	so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-020/a06-020-05.png	I should commit hara-kiri.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-00.png	The small rocket craft, for destroying big
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-01.png	ships, are controlled automatically, even
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-02.png	to the preparations for launching their
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-03.png	rockets. Applauding on the river banks at
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-04.png	Leningrad were thousands now told that in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-05.png	20 years they will have free food, housing, light,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-06.png	heat, transport and medical treatment - all
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-036/a06-036-07.png	for a working week of 34 to 36 hours.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-00.png	&quot;The whole naval might of the Soviet
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-01.png	Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-03.png	commentator. The parade was reviewed by

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-09.png	MACMILLAN'S announcement in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-039/a06-039-10.png	Commons of his momentous
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-00.png	Mr. Anthony Fell (Yarmouth) called the decision &quot;shocking&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-01.png	and added: &quot;It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-02.png	Minister has done for many, many generations.&quot; He
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-03.png	concluded: &quot;The best service the Prime Minister can do
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-04.png	would be to resign.&quot; The outburst shocked MPs of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-05.png	all parties. Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-044/a06-044-06.png	to stop.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-00.png	There were loud cries of &quot;shame&quot; from
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-01.png	all parts of the Conservative side. Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-02.png	Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-03.png	down. A few minutes later, Mr. Fell got up
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-04.png	and left the chamber. He returned five
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-05.png	minutes later to stand just inside the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-06.png	doorway looking more composed. In the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-07.png	middle of the amazing scene, Mr. Macmillan
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-051/a06-051-08.png	waved his hand at Mr. Fell.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-00.png	This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more. &quot;I cannot be told
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-01.png	to sit down by the Prime Minister.&quot; Protests had been expected
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-02.png	from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-03.png	accused the Prime Minister of &quot;political double talk.&quot; &quot;It had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-04.png	the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-057/a06-057-05.png	Minister is a national disaster,&quot; he said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-00.png	Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had, if
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-01.png	anything, rallied support to the Prime Minister.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-02.png	This apparently, was Mr. Macmillan's assessment.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-03.png	He confined his reply to the observation
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-04.png	that Mr. Fell had probably &quot;maximised his
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-05.png	support.&quot; There were no other attacks
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-06.png	of such ferocity. But there was ample
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-07.png	evidence of Conservative and Labour
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-08.png	opposition, which will be aired in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-064/a06-064-09.png	debate tomorrow and on Thursday.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-00.png	As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-01.png	House was crowded. He said: &quot;No # British
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-02.png	Government could join the European Economic
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-03.png	Community without prior negotiation with a view
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-04.png	to meeting the needs of the Commonwealth countries,

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-06.png	and of British agriculture.&quot; Near the end of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-070/a06-070-07.png	long statement, Mr. Macmillan stated the

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-00.png	&quot;After long and earnest consideration, Her
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-01.png	Majesty's Government have come to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-02.png	conclusion that it would be right for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-03.png	Britain to make a formal application..
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-04.png	for negotiations with a view to joining
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-05.png	the Community.&quot; At this point, Mr. Paul
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-06.png	Williams (Cons., Sunderland) called out
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-07.png	&quot;Shame.&quot; Mr. Williams is a close
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-075/a06-075-08.png	associate of Mr. Fell.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-00.png	He claimed that, unless we were in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-01.png	Common Market, we should not be able to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-02.png	play any part in # determining its future.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-03.png	&quot;We can lead better from within,&quot; he said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-04.png	Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-05.png	raised by Tory critics. Mr. Anthony Fell,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-06.png	who created a scene on this point on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-07.png	Monday, took up a position almost hidden
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-090/a06-090-08.png	behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-00.png	Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-01.png	to the Commonwealth through the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-02.png	strength we would gain in the Common
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-03.png	Market than by isolation. He paid
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-04.png	tribute to the development of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-05.png	Common Market. &quot;The Community
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-06.png	(Common Market) has imparted an
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-07.png	impetus and an economic growth
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-08.png	to The Six. Above all, it is an idea
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-09.png	which has gripped men's minds,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-095/a06-095-10.png	he said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-00.png	Referring to previous negotiations, Mr. Macmillan looked towards
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-01.png	Mr. Reginald Maudling. &quot;These were negotiations in which the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-02.png	President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part,&quot; the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-03.png	Premier said. He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-04.png	swamped by cheap labour. Our industry, he said, would
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-05.png	probably gain. &quot;Many people feel we have had, perhaps, too
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-100/a06-100-06.png	much shelter,&quot; he went on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-00.png	She was tempted to laugh, but it was as though that barb still stuck
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-01.png	in her quivering flesh. &quot;You've an answer - of sorts - for everything,&quot; she
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-02.png	said shortly. &quot;Personally I've no more to say, so I suggest we get
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-03.png	along.&quot; To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-04.png	where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-05.png	leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-146/n02-146-06.png	incredibly ancient car, surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-00.png	Conservatives protested when
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-01.png	Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-02.png	told this "by some # people
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-03.png	of considerable authority," he
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-04.png	retorted. "I agree with the Prime
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-05.png	Minister that I do not think
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-06.png	we are necessarily bound for
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-07.png	federalism in Europe," he went
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-110/a06-110-08.png	on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-00.png	If we joined the Common Market, our
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-01.png	food subsidies would probably be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-02.png	replaced by a system of tariffs &quot;That
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-03.png	will mean a rise in the cost of living.&quot;

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-07.png	On the eve of August Bank Holiday
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-114/a06-114-08.png	the spending spree is at a new

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-00.png	Note circulation soared for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-01.png	sixth successive week - this
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-02.png	time by more than 15,000,000 # last
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-03.png	week. And that brought the figure
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-04.png	to a record 2,415,000,000. This was
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-05.png	100,000,000 more than the corresponding
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-06.png	week last year and 37,000,000 up on
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-119/a06-119-07.png	the 1960 record set last Christmas.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-03.png	About another 70,000,000 is due
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-04.png	by September 20. For nearly a year

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-06.png	MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-07.png	German militarism in his replies to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-08.png	the West on Berlin. And he repeats
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-09.png	that the problem &quot;must be solved
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-128/a06-128-10.png	this year.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-00.png	The big &quot;squeeze&quot; means that it is going to be more
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-01.png	difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft. And banks will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-02.png	stricter in recalling existing overdrafts. This is underlined in
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-03.png	the Central Bank's weekly return... ...which shows that more
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-04.png	than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-124/a06-124-05.png	form of special deposits with the Bank of England.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-00.png	The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-01.png	West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday. They
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-02.png	tell: The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-03.png	treaty with Germany causes no real danger. West Germany,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-04.png	with its militarists and revenge-seekers, is becoming a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-05.png	hotbed of war danger in Europe. Even now, aided by
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-06.png	the U.S., Britain and France, it has more than enough
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-134/a06-134-07.png	forces and arms to touch off a world war.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-00.png	BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-01.png	put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-02.png	Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-03.png	cities. FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-04.png	not alarmed.... Next door, in West Germany, before everyone's
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-141/a06-141-05.png	eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-02.png	WEST GERMANY - Russia would like to see a clear #
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-03.png	realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-04.png	of a third world war. The best way to rule out such a tragic
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-05.png	contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-147/a06-147-06.png	growth of West Berlin's occupation status.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-157/a06-157-00.png	This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-157/a06-157-01.png	East German disturbances on July 17, 1953. And officials

dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-05.png	do the strongest arguments lie? THE Archbishop
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-06.png	of Capetown has shown that the matter is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-004/b01-004-07.png	not clear-cut.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-00.png	The Archbishop has long been a courageous
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-01.png	fighter against apartheid. He must be heard
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-02.png	with attention. On purely practical grounds he
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-03.png	holds that it would be a mistake to expel
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-04.png	South Africa, weakening the whites who are
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-05.png	working for a change of policy. In his view
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-06.png	it would also be against the interests of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-009/b01-009-07.png	Africans.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-00.png	He holds that more pressure can be put on South

dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-03.png	On the other hand, those who favour expulsion, inclu-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-04.png	ding African leaders, feel that nothing less than the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-05.png	shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-06.png	Verwoerd and the Nationalists. They point out
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-07.png	that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-014/b01-014-08.png	the apartheid policy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-00.png	THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society. A
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-01.png	policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-02.png	is surely the one thing that it could not survive.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-03.png	Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-04.png	London, millions at home would regard as fraudulent
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-05.png	a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-06.png	South Africa. And this is a Commonwealth in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-07.png	which five citizens are coloured for every one
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-018/b01-018-08.png	who is white.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-00.png	Seen in this wider picture, a South Africa that clings to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-01.png	apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-02.png	liability to the whole Western world. A practical
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-03.png	solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-04.png	a set of principles excluding race discrimination.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-05.png	And so leave South Africa to make the grade,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-023/b01-023-06.png	or go out.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-00.png	THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-01.png	tonight from their tour in the East. The duke's
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-02.png	trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-03.png	have taken the headlines in this country.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-04.png	Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-05.png	success. The Queen has won a triumph. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-06.png	would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-07.png	performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-027/b01-027-08.png	dropped from future Royal programmes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-00.png	But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-01.png	their visit. The warmth of their welcome in India and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-02.png	Pakistan are happy memories. WEST GERMANY - followed
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-03.png	yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-04.png	of a good neighbour. She has put up the value
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-033/b01-033-05.png	of her money.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-00.png	Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-01.png	in the direction of live-and-let-live. Hopes
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-02.png	will now grow brighter of further international
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-03.png	co-operation, which is the only way to solve the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-04.png	payments difficulties that upset the Western world.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-05.png	Britain and the U.S., which have problems with
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-06.png	their balances, will gain some immediate help.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-07.png	What it means in practical terms is that our
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-08.png	exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-09.png	for Germans to buy, while the goods which
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-038/b01-038-10.png	Germany exports will be made a little dearer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-00.png	Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-01.png	as a means to curb rising prices at home. She is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-02.png	also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-03.png	by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-04.png	should. Germany exports much more than she imports.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-05.png	For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-044/b01-044-06.png	dollars have been drained into Germany.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-00.png	There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-01.png	Germany has no tradition of trading abroad. In addition
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-02.png	the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-03.png	speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-04.png	hoping for the mark to rise, as has now happened.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-05.png	WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-06.png	Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-049/b01-049-07.png	off speculation against dollar and pound?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-00.png	That is doubtful. If however, in addition to her new
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-01.png	good-neighbour gesture, Germany takes a really big
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-02.png	share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-03.png	world outlook will be brighter. What gives rise
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-04.png	to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-05.png	other leading Western nations are at long last
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-06.png	moving towards a solution of currency problems
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-053/b01-053-07.png	by co-operation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-00.png	That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-01.png	made. India has responded handsomely by providing
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-02.png	3,000 men, who must take about a fortnight to arrive.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-03.png	If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-04.png	such incidents as that at Matadi would not
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-05.png	happen. THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-06.png	simply on adequate support by the nations
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-084/b01-084-07.png	which have set their hands to this plough.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-00.png	The big Powers involved in the Cold War
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-01.png	must of course keep out. The Americans were
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-02.png	justified in diverting naval ships in case
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-03.png	non-combatant help was wanted; but they
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-04.png	stressed that there was no intention to intervene
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-05.png	in fighting. Yesterday the ships turned away
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-06.png	again, satisfied that they were not required.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-07.png	It is to be hoped that the UN will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-08.png	re-established in their port by negotiation
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-089/b01-089-09.png	and that there will be no more outrages.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-00.png	But back, Mr. Hammarskjold is determined,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-01.png	they must go. The best news for the Congo
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-02.png	would be agreement between its rival
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-03.png	political leaders. Through the patient efforts
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-04.png	of UN conciliators they are meeting for
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-05.png	the first time, in Malagasy (formerly
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-06.png	Madagascar). THE world will sigh with
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-07.png	relief when this strife-torn land gets
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-08.png	itself a government which all outsiders
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-094/b01-094-09.png	can recognise.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-00.png	ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-01.png	as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as &quot;a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-02.png	policy of good neighbourliness.&quot; We may be sure that
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-03.png	he is not being hypocritical. That is what he
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-04.png	really believes. A good neighbour to those Africans
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-05.png	who, under apartheid, will be forced back to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-06.png	their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-113/b01-113-07.png	cramped and primitive existence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-00.png	A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-01.png	tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-02.png	water in the white areas of South Africa, without rights
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-03.png	and without hope. THE same sort of good neighbour
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-04.png	that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-05.png	Hitler in the thirties. It was Dr. Verwoerd who
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-06.png	led a protest against admitting any of them
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-07.png	because they would &quot;defile&quot; the national
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-118/b01-118-08.png	white stock.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-00.png	It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-01.png	woerd in his nightmare world. It is this that
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-02.png	makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-03.png	fluenced to change course. The Archbishop of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-04.png	Capetown, Dr. Joost de Blank, has pleaded that
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-05.png	South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-06.png	Commonwealth. Otherwise, he says, those inside the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-07.png	country who still oppose apartheid will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-122/b01-122-08.png	left even more isolated and alone.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-00.png	The views of the Archbishop, who has
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-01.png	maintained an unflinching witness to what
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-02.png	Christianity really means, must carry weight. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-03.png	what, in fact, can the other Commonwealth countries
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-04.png	do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-05.png	minority? THERE is no evidence that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-06.png	policy of appeasement has modified the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-07.png	actions of the Nationalists. On the contrary,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-08.png	apartheid is being applied ever more
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-127/b01-127-09.png	ruthlessly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-00.png	The shock of expulsion from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-01.png	Commonwealth now seems to be the only
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-02.png	way left to try to bring home to the people of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-03.png	South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-04.png	to disaster. It may be that the Commonwealth
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-05.png	Prime Ministers will decide against this final
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-06.png	step. If that is their decision they should also
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-07.png	go unequivocally on record that they regard
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-132/b01-132-08.png	apartheid as evil and indefensible.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-00.png	Unless they do at least that, Dr. Verwoerd will
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-01.png	be able to return home claiming a triumph.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-02.png	His smile will be blander than ever. WE are in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-03.png	for it again: another Royal Wedding. Between
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-04.png	now and June, when the Duke of Kent will
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-05.png	marry Miss Worsley, hardly a day will pass
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-06.png	without a story or a picture or probably both,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-136/b01-136-07.png	about the nuptial arrangements.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-00.png	What seems certain is that those who
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-01.png	advocate putting off any approach until
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-02.png	Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-03.png	of heart (whatever that may mean) would
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-04.png	have us run risks greater than the West
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-05.png	ought to run - and greater than President
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-06.png	Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-07.png	disposed to face. The real question is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-08.png	what we should put to the Soviet
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-013/b02-013-09.png	Government as a basis for talks: and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-00.png	On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-01.png	manoeuvring, and what we should call
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-02.png	cool-headed and inventive negotiation, is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-03.png	a means not to destruction but to safety.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-04.png	The Government's pompous little statement
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-05.png	on Northern Rhodesia does not say much,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-06.png	but it says what is necessary - that
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-07.png	the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-08.png	open to revision. This is news, however
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-09.png	much the Government tries to disguise
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-035/b02-035-10.png	it by saying that the revision would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-00.png	To be able to say &quot;New York next week&quot; is an
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-01.png	important advance. We must not be overconfident
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-02.png	that this # meeting will lead on to further
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-03.png	and decisive ones; but without it, we could not
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-04.png	look for them. Federal Germany votes tomorrow
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-05.png	and not a day too soon. There can seldom have
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-06.png	been an election campaign which more people
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-07.png	in and out of the country wanted to see over
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-097/b02-097-08.png	and done with.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-00.png	But they were so convinced and they
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-01.png	have had to take the consequences. Mean-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-02.png	while in Germany itself the course of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-03.png	the campaign has dismayed a good
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-04.png	many people: they too will be glad
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-105/b02-105-05.png	when the polling stations close.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-00.png	But discussion on current points of east-west con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-01.png	flict could not go much farther than, for example, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-02.png	truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-03.png	cannot be followed together. What the council has done -
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-04.png	and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-05.png	tact across the greatest political barrier in what
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-025/b03-025-06.png	is not yet a unitary world.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-00.png	The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-01.png	agreement is signed. To this there will be some opposition. The Bill is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-02.png	short and modest in scope, and it is doubtful whether the other Private
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-03.png	Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps. This fact may give
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-04.png	the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-087/b03-087-05.png	next report from the Molony committee.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-00.png	Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable. They should not,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-01.png	however, disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-02.png	parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-03.png	Centigrade v. Fahrenheit. The fight is on. The challenger has behind
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-04.png	it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-05.png	but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-092/b03-092-06.png	logical Office.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-00.png	The press and the broadcasting authorities are
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-01.png	asked to help. To begin with, both tempe-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-02.png	ratures will be put in the ring together.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-03.png	SIR GRAHAM SUTTON, however, made no bones
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-04.png	about it yesterday. The purpose is to give
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-05.png	fahrenheit the knock out. The backers of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-06.png	centigrade would have got off to a better
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-07.png	start if they had taken more pains to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-08.png	explain the advantages to the general
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-098/b03-098-09.png	public of the change.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-00.png	It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-01.png	at the moment &quot;an awful mess up&quot; in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-02.png	the measurement of temperatures. This,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-03.png	however, seems a matter of the convenience
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-04.png	of specialists. The ordinary British man
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-05.png	and woman is conscious of no difficulty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-06.png	Rather than fifty million people having
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-07.png	to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-08.png	any reason why the centigrade countries
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-104/b03-104-09.png	should not change to fahrenheit?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-00.png	Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-01.png	strably better than the other? The centigraders may
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-02.png	be in for a stiffer fight than they think. They may
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-03.png	have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-04.png	Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-05.png	public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-06.png	circumstances the time would come when this would
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-07.png	suit their convenience - rather than to change their
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-109/b03-109-08.png	system of recording temperatures.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-00.png	In any case, fahrenheit need not lose heart.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-01.png	Once before, and that not so long ago, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-02.png	authorities ganged up to alter the habits
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-03.png	of the people. That effort was to enforce
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-04.png	the adoption of the twenty-four hour
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-05.png	clock. Then, also, the B.B.C. were
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-06.png	roped in. The only result was
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-07.png	that the well-meaning corporation
dataset/iam_lines/data/b03/b03-114/b03-114-08.png	became very unpopular.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-00.png	A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-01.png	stands at the centre of an international
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-02.png	storm. Belgium is accused - without a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-03.png	scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-04.png	the murder of Patrice Lumumba. Her
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-05.png	leaders are insulted, her embassies are
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-000/b04-000-06.png	attacked in a score of countries.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-00.png	In Ghana, President Nkrumah, who
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-01.png	has done more than most to stir up
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-02.png	trouble in the Congo, orders every Belgian
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-03.png	citizen to quit his country. HOUNDING
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-04.png	Belgium has become an international
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-05.png	pastime. Why? Because those who
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-06.png	said the Congolese could govern themselves
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-07.png	will not admit they were wrong. So
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-08.png	Belgium, bowed down by internal
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-09.png	troubles, mourning a terrible air crash,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-004/b04-004-10.png	is made their scapegoat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-00.png	Who will speak for Belgium? Who else but
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-01.png	Britain. We have fought beside Belgium
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-02.png	in two world wars. We are allies still.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-03.png	Britain should champion Belgium. Not
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-04.png	with the careful, hooded language of diplomacy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-05.png	but boldly and fearlessly. It is time to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-06.png	show the world that this country does not
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-07.png	desert her friends. HAPPY, happy
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-08.png	families! Never before have Britain's
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-010/b04-010-09.png	larders been so well stocked.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-00.png	Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-01.png	substantially higher last year than in 1959.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-02.png	Lucky, lucky housewives! To have such a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-03.png	splendid variety of goods to choose from.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-04.png	Not so long ago older folk were reminding

dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-06.png	shortages, of the good old days of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-07.png	abundance. Now it is mother who
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-020/b04-020-08.png	picks up recipes from # her daughter.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-00.png	The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-01.png	Britain today! &quot;THIS is colour day,&quot; proclaimed the American
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-02.png	television network, N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-03.png	programmes in bright colours. In America colour TV is five years
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-04.png	old. There are already 600,000 sets in use. What about Britain?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-05.png	The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service, but the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-026/b04-026-06.png	commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-00.png	The Government should settle this argument with two words to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-01.png	the B.B.C.: - Go ahead! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-02.png	by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-03.png	they had to leave their cottage. Mr. John Crabb, clerk to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-04.png	Newmarket urban council, says: "I shall always feel this as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-034/b04-034-05.png	personal failure."
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-00.png	There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-01.png	sisters had to quit as their home was falling down. And Mr. Crabb
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-02.png	did his best for them, even driving them to a new house. John
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-03.png	Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding. Too
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-04.png	often lacking in officialdom. MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-040/b04-040-05.png	does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-00.png	He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-01.png	be in England. The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-02.png	Scot. The Lord Chancellor is a Scot. The Prime Minister is a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-03.png	Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-04.png	Let Mr. Newton beware. By protesting against Scotland he
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-047/b04-047-05.png	may be guilty of rebellion!
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-00.png	ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-01.png	His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-02.png	five years. During this period Britain will be expected
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-03.png	to subsidise and defend the Cypriots. They will enjoy
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-04.png	all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference. It is a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-05.png	safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-054/b04-054-06.png	company will sign on again.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-00.png	It is equally certain that the British Government
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-01.png	will welcome them. How splendid it would be if, just
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-02.png	for once, the Government were to voice the real feelings of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-03.png	the British people. And tell Makarios they are not
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-04.png	prepared to accept him on such terms. GOOD cheer
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-05.png	for the week-end. Ford Motors are to put 13,000
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-060/b04-060-06.png	men back on a five-day week.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-00.png	One more demonstration of the industry's recovery. As
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-01.png	springtime approaches, orders pick up. And the car men get
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-02.png	ready for another bustling season. The pessimists
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-03.png	said the motor industry was on its knees. The optimists
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-04.png	said &quot;Nonsense.&quot; As usual, the optimists have been
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-05.png	proved right. EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-066/b04-066-06.png	hit on an original way of spending this afternoon.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-00.png	They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence. It is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-01.png	their protest against the H-bomb. They ought to have a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-02.png	pleasant time. The weather forecast is good; except for them,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-03.png	Whitehall should be deserted. And they will have a fine view
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-04.png	of St. James's Park, with its placid lake, pelicans,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-075/b04-075-05.png	rare ducks, and other wild life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-00.png	Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-01.png	Head for the parks to enjoy the sun. Not in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-02.png	a foolish cause, but in a glorious one. Good health!
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-03.png	THIS group of men, says a report, work on average
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-04.png	between 55 and 60 hours a week. They also put
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-05.png	in an extra two or three evenings. And they never
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-081/b04-081-06.png	go on strike.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-00.png	Who are they? The trade union officials of Britain.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-01.png	Men who earn only a fraction of what their
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-02.png	talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-03.png	labour market. The unions are fortunate indeed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-04.png	find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices. But it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-05.png	time the members decided to pay up and be good
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-06.png	employers. THE Labour Party says that the Tory
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-089/b04-089-07.png	Government is destroying the social services.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-00.png	Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-01.png	national income was spent on social services. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-02.png	present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-03.png	worthwhile targets for the Opposition. What a pity
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-04.png	to aim at the wrong one! MRS. MARCIA POWER,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-05.png	whose husband made her clean his uniform, wins
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-06.png	a divorce. The judge says she had to act almost
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-096/b04-096-07.png	as a serf.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-00.png	Up and down the country husbands will be saying
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-01.png	they would never behave like that. But do they ever
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-02.png	ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-03.png	returned to the shed; their books tidied; and often,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-04.png	even their shoes cleaned? How wonderful if they
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-05.png	showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-103/b04-103-06.png	box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers!
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-00.png	HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-01.png	in Rhodesia! Eighteen months ago this territory
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-02.png	was peaceful, orderly, and thriving. Africans within the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-03.png	Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-04.png	administration. Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-05.png	Secretary. Suddenly everything changed. Timetables were
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-06.png	scrapped. The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-07.png	rushed out to Rhodesia. Overnight, minor African
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-107/b04-107-08.png	politicians were inflated into international figures.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-00.png	And as the British Government stepped up the pace
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-01.png	of change, so the Africans stepped up their demands.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-02.png	TODAY, in London, that rash and thoughtless policy has
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-03.png	caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-04.png	No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-05.png	If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-06.png	Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-116/b04-116-07.png	difficulties from African politicians greedy for power.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-00.png	But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-01.png	be plunged into chaos, like the Congo. For Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-02.png	Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice. They
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-03.png	must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos. And try to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-04.png	repair the damage they have done. WHO can grow the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-05.png	fastest? That is the exciting competition going on
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-121/b04-121-06.png	among Britain's major industries.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-00.png	Top of the table, at the moment, is the chemical industry.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-01.png	Then comes engineering, followed by iron and steel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-02.png	Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-03.png	tremendous upsurge in investment. It reports that new
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-04.png	factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-05.png	up on 1960. Britain's business men are right to back
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-128/b04-128-06.png	their faith with cash.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-00.png	For expansion today means still greater
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-01.png	prosperity tomorrow. BERTRAND RUSSELL,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-02.png	the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-03.png	the-Bomb crusade, has devoted following.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-04.png	Thousands march with him - and sit with him
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-05.png	too. It is said by some that he is a saint; by
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-06.png	others that he is a prophet. He is, in fact, a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-07.png	philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-08.png	who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-134/b04-134-09.png	issues of our time.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-00.png	BEFORE the war he urged the British people
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-01.png	to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-02.png	After the war he favoured a preventive war against
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-03.png	Russia. Now he wants Britain to demolish her
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-04.png	defences. Throughout the years Lord Russell
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-05.png	and his supporters have been able to pursue their
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-06.png	eccentric campaigns in freedom. They should
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-07.png	ask themselves this question: How long would
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-140/b04-140-08.png	that freedom last if their policies were adopted?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-00.png	AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-01.png	Board. The board is laying a cable along a seven-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-02.png	mile route in Surrey. A warden, Mr. Jack Finlay,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-03.png	has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-04.png	householders when trenches are dug outside their
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-05.png	front gates. Splendid. By showing concern
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-06.png	for the people the board will earn their good will.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-147/b04-147-07.png	Happy patrolling, Mr. Finlay!
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-00.png	GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky! The tough,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-01.png	resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-02.png	shakes the life out of his critics. He calls them
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-03.png	&quot;jelly-boned.&quot; He promises to preserve federation
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-04.png	against African fanatics and woolly minded
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-05.png	individuals in the West. Some may ask: Is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-06.png	Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-154/b04-154-07.png	disagree with him? The facts answer that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-00.png	CONTRAST his firm, successful rule in Rhodesia
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-01.png	with what has happened in the Congo. There
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-02.png	Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-03.png	into practice. There a UNO army of Africans,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-04.png	bossed by an Indian, has been in charge for
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-05.png	months. And what has it made of the Congo?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-06.png	A bloodstained shambles. No wonder
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-07.png	Welensky has lost all patience with his
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-162/b04-162-08.png	misguided tormentors.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-00.png	They have earned his strictures. And his
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-01.png	contempt. SOME people are for ever complaining
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-02.png	that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-03.png	when they get it. Now a survey of the Post
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-04.png	Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-05.png	idea is. The biggest group of depositors in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-06.png	the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-169/b04-169-07.png	to 19.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-00.png	Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-01.png	Certainly they spend more. But how splendid
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-02.png	that in the most prosperous days in this
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-03.png	country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-04.png	should still have a powerful appeal for young
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-05.png	people. THE Danes are annoyed with British
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-06.png	farmers for fighting against Danish competition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-07.png	They say that our farmers do not seem to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-175/b04-175-08.png	understand the meaning of free trade.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-00.png	There is no doubt what the Danes understand
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-01.png	by free trade. It is that they should be free
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-02.png	to sell as much as they like, while buying
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-03.png	more and more from our rivals. Germany has
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-04.png	now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-05.png	principal supplier. The farmers of Britain
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-06.png	understand free trade. That is why they fight
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-181/b04-181-07.png	it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-00.png	THE Palace cinema at Buckley, near Chester, will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-01.png	reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-02.png	Platt, both aged 19. Eric says: &quot;We believe in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-03.png	cinema. And we know what people want.&quot; The
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-04.png	combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-05.png	of public taste has launched many great
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-06.png	enterprises. Barry and Eric have enthusiasm. They
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-187/b04-187-07.png	are backed by a resurgent film industry.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-00.png	It could be curtain up on two success stories. Of
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-01.png	the old Palace. And Barry and Eric. DONS at
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-02.png	Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-03.png	an honours degree course. Farming is Britain's
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-04.png	most vital industry. It is increasingly dependent
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-05.png	on new techniques - and on the universities to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-195/b04-195-06.png	provide men of knowledge and skill.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-00.png	The older universities are often accused of being
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-01.png	interested only in dead subjects. Now Cambridge has
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-02.png	the opportunity to show is just as interested in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-03.png	living. Particularly as its rival, Oxford, has had a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-202/b04-202-04.png	similar course in farming for 15 years!

dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-208/b04-208-00.png	At the beginning of this wonderful century many
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-208/b04-208-01.png	people believed that there were no more worlds to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b04/b04-208/b04-208-02.png	conquer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-00.png	Nobody's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around!&quot; He then
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-01.png	took out a piece of paper, wrote his address on it and added:
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-02.png	&quot;Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-03.png	first. I won't stand for it.&quot; Exit a puzzled American.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-017/b05-017-04.png	The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg

dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-00.png	The travellers from the New World who had
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-01.png	been in Britain many times before, were
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-02.png	slightly stunned. Afterwards they said: &quot;We thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-03.png	we knew it all, but you Britishers never run
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-04.png	out of unturned stones.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-05.png	To the British Travel Association, doing their excellent
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-06.png	darndest, I offer these sad complexities. IN the 1830's
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-07.png	the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-08.png	many a good trade unionist since then has, in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-032/b05-032-09.png	hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers, taken

dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-055/b05-055-00.png	The village green is the real home of cricket. A couple of bumps
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-055/b05-055-01.png	on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-055/b05-055-02.png	heart, a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-055/b05-055-03.png	batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-055/b05-055-04.png	mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-00.png	They'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-01.png	EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-02.png	German mind. Not content with arguing that he was only an
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-03.png	efficient cog in the machine, he now claims that part of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-04.png	endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-058/b05-058-05.png	"decent, feasible and workable."
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-00.png	He feels satisfaction &quot;from the fact that my personality had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-01.png	tested and weighed and not found wanting.&quot; He feels like
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-02.png	Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-03.png	saying: &quot;I am innocent of the blood of this just person.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-04.png	Like Dr. Globke, whom I interviewed the other day, Eichmann
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-062/b05-062-05.png	said:
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-00.png	"I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-01.png	could despite my low rank." Eichmann is on dangerous ground
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-02.png	when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-03.png	of the triangle that led to Hitler, Himmler, Hess and Goering
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-04.png	at the apex. In examination he betrayed an expert and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-05.png	intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-067/b05-067-06.png	led to the top.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-00.png	He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-01.png	meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-02.png	who used the system - and used it with power and authority.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-03.png	The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-04.png	selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
dataset/iam_lines/data/b05/b05-071/b05-071-05.png	red with blood.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-00.png	So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-01.png	&quot;Werewolves&quot; that we had contemplated the necessity of very
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-02.png	special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen. Particular
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-03.png	hatred, we felt, was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-04.png	those who had, over the years, spread such ghastly havoc, destruction
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-05.png	and death over Germany, causing such wholesale slaughter among
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-098/g05-098-06.png	men, women and children, old and young alike.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-00.png	5. Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
dataset/iam_lines/data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-01.png	are highway payments, clearance payments (for clearing remains of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-02.png	structures from &quot;total loss&quot; sites) and church payments. Although
dataset/iam_lines/data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-03.png	differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h05/h05-012/h05-012-04.png	works payments, the sums paid under these heads have the

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-05.png	Later that year he warned that Britain knew

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-000/b06-000-07.png	building bombers, and added:

dataset/iam_lines/data/c06/c06-100/c06-100-00.png	So all ends as you know it will, with the

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-01.png	Herr Strauss, started talks with the British
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-02.png	Defence Minister, Mr. Watkinson. Their talks
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-03.png	are another stage in the cloak operation,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-04.png	1961 variety, by which the West German
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-05.png	militarists are advancing their rearmament.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-06.png	Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-008/b06-008-07.png	that his policy was to make his country

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-00.png	They obstructed every effort to fight for the

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-06.png	and the call for party unity - in effect,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-056/b06-056-07.png	a demand that the movement unite

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-00.png	This should strengthen the campaign to

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-02.png	nuclear weapons in Britain. Britain then
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-093/b06-093-03.png	could play a leading and independent

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-00.png	All this has been achieved through Nato under

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-02.png	played not only by the British Government but
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-03.png	by Right-Wing Labour in this country. They have
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-04.png	helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-05.png	in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-032/b06-032-06.png	policy which brought disaster in 1939.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-00.png	It would become easy to become cynical and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-01.png	to despair. And yet, wherever the issues were put
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-02.png	clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-03.png	original stand. Only where the issues were

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-06.png	immediate confusion hides the fact that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-059/b06-059-07.png	Peace movement is still advancing and that

dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-03.png	survey of a life work. P. J. K. HANS WERNER
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-04.png	HENZE'S &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; is the first

dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-06.png	admitted to the Glyndebourne canon. By no

dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-009/c01-009-08.png	a representative modern work and the composer

dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-01.png	is largely a satire on the petty court
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-02.png	surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-03.png	egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-04.png	everything to his need of inspiration. Henze
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-05.png	obtains his musical characterisation by means
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-06.png	of individual instrumental timbres and &quot;personal&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-07.png	intervals, and the result is often less delineation
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-08.png	of character than caricature. This is also the chief,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-09.png	or at least the most successfully executed trait
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-014/c01-014-10.png	of the libretto, which contains an odd blend of highly

dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-066/c01-066-08.png	classes in the early 19th century which
dataset/iam_lines/data/c01/c01-066/c01-066-09.png	leaves one a little breathless.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-00.png	It would now seem that Wicki's name must
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-01.png	be added to this list, for his new film
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-02.png	may well be a landmark in the revitali-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-03.png	sation of the German cinema. Wicki is
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-04.png	not only a director. He began his career
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-05.png	as an actor, had his first important
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-06.png	film ro*?5le in Ka&quot;utner's &quot;Die letzt
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-07.png	Bru&quot;cke,&quot; and he also appears in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-003/c02-003-08.png	new Antonioni film.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-00.png	In 1950 he began to take photographs not
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-01.png	only in Germany but also in Africa and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-02.png	America. An exhibition of these works which
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-03.png	is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-04.png	pressive. As Friedrich Du&quot;rrenmatt, the Swiss
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-05.png	playwright and author, wrote: &quot;Wicki's blacks
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-06.png	and greys are not only the colours of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-07.png	lost and the forgotten, but they are also the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-007/c02-007-08.png	technical means of abstraction.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-00.png	Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-01.png	considerable fidelity, the film tells the story
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-02.png	of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-03.png	table night club near his church be re-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-04.png	moved. One night his prayer is answered
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-05.png	and the offending establishment is suddenly
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-06.png	transplanted to an island in the North Sea.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-07.png	But Father Malachias's troubles have only
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-08.png	begun. Instead of having the desired effect,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-017/c02-017-09.png	the miracle becomes exploited by a group
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-00.png	Every unnecessary detail, all superfluous local
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-01.png	colouring must be eliminated. He does not
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-02.png	want the accuracy of a police photograph,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-03.png	but rather he wants to show the eternal in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-04.png	every instant.&quot; The chilling horror of &quot;Mala-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-05.png	chias&quot; is due as much to Wicki the photo-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-06.png	grapher as to Wicki the director. His earlier
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-07.png	film, &quot;Die Bru&quot;cke,&quot; was equally terrifying,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-08.png	but here the director moves out of the world
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-012/c02-012-09.png	of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-00.png	Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-01.png	the missing building. The Church rebukes the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-02.png	poor monk for his miracle, and as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-03.png	crowning indignity the night club is
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-04.png	given a gala society reopening on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-05.png	island. Father Malachias goes to the island,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-06.png	prays, and in a second miracle the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-07.png	night club is replaced in its original
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-022/c02-022-08.png	setting.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-00.png	A summary of the story can give almost
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-01.png	indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-02.png	tells his story best in the faces of his crowds,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-03.png	recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-04.png	with brutal honesty, building up to a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-05.png	tremendous climax in the island orgy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-06.png	Here, the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-07.png	the wildly flapping white sails slashed by
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-026/c02-026-08.png	the glaring beacon of a lighthouse.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-00.png	When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-01.png	marvellous joke; no one has learned anything. Wicki
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-02.png	suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-03.png	complete silence he shows the faces of people
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-04.png	walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-05.png	and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-06.png	succeeded in his second film in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-07.png	recording his personal apocalypse of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-030/c02-030-08.png	last days of a sick society.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-00.png	It is most unfair to call &quot;Malachias&quot; a cut-rate
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-01.png	&quot;Dolce Vita,&quot; for it is far more intimate and deeply
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-02.png	felt. In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-03.png	in &quot;Titanic&quot; by paralleling the last days of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-04.png	Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-035/c02-035-05.png	and paid for his audacity with his life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-00.png	Strangely enough, the Berlin audience received
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-01.png	the film with extreme coolness, much preferring
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-02.png	Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing &quot;Une Femme
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-03.png	est une Femme,&quot; a ninety-one minute hymn
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-04.png	to &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Cahiers du Cinema,&quot; and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-05.png	worst aspects of the American cinema. From
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-06.png	a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-07.png	out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-08.png	and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-049/c02-049-09.png	uninitiated (including four plugs for Charles

dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-01.png	Prizes being what they are, Berlin is unusually
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-02.png	generous in giving everyone something, and silver
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-03.png	bears are awarded in every direction. Both the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-04.png	Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-05.png	and the audience at the awards was particularly
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-06.png	enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-07.png	as best actress for her work in the Godard
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-08.png	film. Gifted with an interesting face, although little
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-09.png	acting ability, she would seem to be well
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-059/c02-059-10.png	worth watching in the months to come.

dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-07.png	from Jeanne Moreau, this has been fairly
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-08.png	well trounced by the critics wherever it
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-082/c02-082-09.png	has appeared. Leisurely, even slow,

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-02.png	Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been produced
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-03.png	an directed by Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-04.png	part-author with Miss Delaney of the script,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-05.png	and the great advantages to be derived from

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000a/c03-000a-07.png	everywhere apparent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-01.png	conceived throughout in terms of the cinema,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-02.png	and again and again it is the visual qualities
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-03.png	of the story, and the marriage of the central
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-04.png	characters to their background, which bring
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-05.png	the film so vividly to life. In Fanny, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-06.png	also has its premiere tomorrow, the director,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-07.png	Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed to create
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003a/c03-003a-08.png	the atmosphere of a city.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-01.png	taken a town in the industrial North of England
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-02.png	and has made it live. The shabby streets and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-03.png	wet pavements, the school play-grounds, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-04.png	public monuments and the rubbish strewn canals -
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-05.png	even the worn head-stones in the churchyard,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-06.png	&quot;sacred to the memory of&quot; - are seen as an
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007a/c03-007a-07.png	integral part of the story.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-01.png	intense realism in the situation. A young
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-02.png	girl lives in a single dingy room with
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-03.png	her slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-04.png	surroundings she learns sex is something
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-05.png	sordid, and when she experiences it for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-06.png	first time herself it is incoherently, clumsily,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-07.png	but half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-08.png	her first lover is a sailor who leaves her
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016a/c03-016a-09.png	to bear his child and sails away.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-01.png	an old man. Here it is a young homosexual,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-02.png	estranged from women but yet moved by a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-03.png	strong maternal instinct to the unborn child
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-04.png	as much as to the expectant mother, who acts
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-05.png	as a protector and comforter to her in her
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-06.png	hour of need. He shares her room and gives
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-07.png	her his forlorn gift of companionship and sym-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-08.png	pathy - &quot;you need someone to love you while
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021a/c03-021a-09.png	you are looking for someone to love&quot;.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-01.png	technical error in allowing Irene to speak
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-02.png	for herself; we would be altogether clearer
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-03.png	in our minds about her if she remained
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-04.png	a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but not
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-05.png	heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-06.png	few brief scenes effective, and Mr. Dinsdale
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-07.png	Landen, in the longest and most exacting role,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-08.png	that of the sergeant, gives a performance of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081a/c03-081a-09.png	rare intelligence and restrained power.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-00.png	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084a/c03-084a-01.png	effective, giving full value to the formal elements

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-01.png	throughout in terms of the cinema, and again and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-02.png	again it is the visual qualities of the story, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-03.png	the marriage of the central characters to their
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-04.png	background, which bring the film so vividly to life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-05.png	In Fanny, which also has its premiere tomorrow,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003b/c03-003b-06.png	the director, Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken a

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007b/c03-007b-02.png	has made it live. The shabby streets and wet pavements,

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an intense
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-01.png	realism in the situation. A young girl lives in

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-04.png	learns sex is something sordid, and when she
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-05.png	experiences it for the first time herself it
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-06.png	is incoherently, clumsily, but half shyly and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-07.png	half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny her
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-08.png	first lover is a sailor who leaves her to bear
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016b/c03-016b-09.png	his child and sails away.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an old
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-01.png	man. Here it is a young homosexual, estranged from
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-02.png	women but yet moved by a strong maternal instinct to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-03.png	the unborn child as much as to the expectant mother,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-04.png	who acts as a protector and comforter to her in her hour
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-05.png	of need. He shares her room and gives her his forlorn
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021b/c03-021b-06.png	gift of companionship and sympathy - "you need

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-04.png	beautiful enigma, seen but not heard. However,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-05.png	Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her few brief scenes
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-06.png	effective, and Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-07.png	the longest and most exacting role, that of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081b/c03-081b-08.png	sergeant, gives a performance of rare intelligence

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-05.png	was a morality on the not unfamiliar theme of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084c/c03-084c-06.png	the destructive power of unbridled ambition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-00.png	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most treatments

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-04.png	mable desolation. We could, perhaps, say whether
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-05.png	or not the attempt succeeded if we had a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-06.png	little more faith in the way in which Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087c/c03-087c-07.png	Ferris manipulated his characters.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-00.png	Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensitively
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-01.png	pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife, always palely
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-02.png	appealing, Mr. James Maxwell, the editor, always
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-03.png	comically abashed by the events, and Mr. Aubrey
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-04.png	Richards, the father-in-law, always comically
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-05.png	grotesque; they were not asked to modulate from
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-06.png	their set moods but played with proper effi-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-07.png	ciency and, in the case of Mr. Richards, with
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094c/c03-094c-08.png	lavish and suitably gaudy colour.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose explicably
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-01.png	from appreciable motives. The rest, one feels, were
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-02.png	driven to effective action by the author in spite
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-03.png	of the ineffectuality with which he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-04.png	endowed them. One hopes that he is not
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-05.png	asking us to believe that, because of their odd
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-06.png	accents, they act oddly like the queer foreigners
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096c/c03-096c-07.png	of tradition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-01.png	a town in the industrial North of England
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-02.png	and has made it live. The shabby streets
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-03.png	and wet pavements, the school play-grounds,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-04.png	the public monuments and the rubbish
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-05.png	strewn canals - even the worn head-stones
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-06.png	in the churchyard, &quot;sacred to the memory of&quot; -
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007/c03-007-07.png	are seen as an integral part of the story.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-00.png	In his first Hollywood picture, &quot;Let's Make Love,&quot; he
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-01.png	was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-02.png	and Yves Montand. Against this couple Frankie, in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-03.png	a cardboard role, didn't stand a chance. Now comes
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-04.png	&quot;The Right Approach&quot; (Rialto, &quot;A&quot;), and it's a glum
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-05.png	business. He plays an aspiring actor - a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-06.png	selfish, arrogant, brash, ambitious, unscrupulous heel -
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-07.png	who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-008/c04-008-08.png	the Hollywood ratrace.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-00.png	He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-01.png	cheats a waitress (Juliet Prowse) and cynically uses
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-02.png	a magazine editress (Martha Hyer) to get ahead.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-03.png	Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-04.png	true as a smooth-tongued, ill-mannered Yank. His
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-05.png	best moments are when he swings breezily into the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-013/c04-013-06.png	title song.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-00.png	HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-01.png	family man or father-to-be. Unlike many
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-02.png	commercial articles, this chair is solidly built and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-03.png	capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-04.png	most destructive youngster. Almost any available
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-05.png	timber can be used but Parana pine is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-06.png	recommended, being cheap, easy to work, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-000/e04-000-07.png	taking a good finish.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-00.png	But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-01.png	for a new hit song. He might be well advised to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-02.png	think hard and long before his next jump into the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-03.png	Hollywood arena.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-04.png	VERDICT: Vaughan should have by-passed this approach.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-05.png	RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-06.png	Hollywood treatment, thanks to a sound performance in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-017/c04-017-07.png	&quot;Taste of Fear&quot; (Warner Theatre, &quot;X&quot;).
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-00.png	Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-01.png	newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-02.png	loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-03.png	the river. The film starts off brightly enough but,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-04.png	half-way through, the plot (as well as the boat) springs
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-05.png	a near-disastrous leak. Familiar members of Britain's
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-06.png	repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-035/c04-035-07.png	equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-00.png	VERDICT: The &quot;bunk&quot; needed doubling.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-01.png	DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-02.png	&quot;Drama '61&quot; last night as a smooth,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-03.png	scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-04.png	Gillies, &quot;The Takers.&quot; A polished production
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-05.png	by Quentin Lawrence, here, held together
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-06.png	by Mr. Houston's accomplished
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-07.png	performance as the master mind behind a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-039/c04-039-08.png	gang of crooks.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-00.png	This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-01.png	worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious. The play
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-02.png	had style, moved at a quick pace and everyone did
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-03.png	well. But it was Mr. Houston's evening.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-04.png	Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-05.png	Holloway's act too long and not particularly
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-06.png	entertaining. It was also a mistake to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-07.png	re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-044/c04-044-08.png	so soon after their previous appearance.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-00.png	Their offering last night differed little
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-01.png	from their earlier act on this show a week
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-02.png	or so ago. But the Mudlarks, with Jeff Mudd
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-03.png	out of the Army and back with sister Mary
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-04.png	and brother Fred, were in bright, zestful
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-05.png	form. Why only two numbers, though? It
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-06.png	was not enough. &quot;A FAIR COP,&quot; the B B C
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-07.png	Whitehall farce last night, looked like
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-050/c04-050-08.png	a rabbit warren in a field of corn.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-00.png	I can't recall a production where so many
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-01.png	comics bolted in and out of holes so often.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-02.png	The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-03.png	lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-04.png	of his trousers. The action moved at tremendous
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-05.png	speed, backed by some wonderful timing by
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-06.png	the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-07.png	scene where six of the cast changed
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-056/c04-056-08.png	cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-00.png	Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-01.png	as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable. They
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-02.png	alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-03.png	through the gormless standing corn around them. Perhaps
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-04.png	it was accidental - I hope not. If ever a bag of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-05.png	humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-061/c04-061-06.png	farce is it when it comes to television.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-00.png	HOW do you get on records? Well, you've got
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-01.png	to have something different. Sing slightly flat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-02.png	All the good singers sing in tune. Twang a guitar
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-03.png	slightly off key. Everybody's fed up with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-04.png	right way - so the best-seller charts say. Play
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-05.png	an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one. You got to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-06.png	get it into your head, son... people
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-07.png	don't like things as they should be - not on
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-066/c04-066-08.png	record, anyway.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-00.png	Then he tried it out for sound. Um-chink...
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-01.png	um-chink... it went. Slightly flat and jangly in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-02.png	part. DELIGHTFUL! He put the sound on tape. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-03.png	tape went to the Philips company. Within two
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-04.png	days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract. And they
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-05.png	hauled his thumb-tacked joanna the thirteen
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-080/c04-080-06.png	miles to London for his first session.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-00.png	"I feel I've done all I can at the B B C," he
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-01.png	told me. "We mutually agreed to part."
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-02.png	Escapologist Dill-Russell is a guest in Harbin's
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-03.png	show tonight. Boxing fans can see an eight-round

dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-05.png	Harry Carroll from Leicester (B B C, 8.25). A
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-06.png	SONGS-OF-BRITAIN medley is sung by David
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-128/c04-128-07.png	Hughes in his "Make Mine Music" (B B C, 9.30 p.m.).
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-00.png	Now along comes his solo disc, featuring two of his own
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-01.png	compositions, &quot;Deerstalker&quot; and &quot;Almost Grown Up.&quot; VERDICT:
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-02.png	Mr. Lisbon has it taped. And tacked. And he says: &quot;Just as well
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-03.png	I had only one box of tacks - it might have been so
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-04.png	different....&quot; More news from the ivory-thumping dept....
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-05.png	Russ Conway, who has tinkled his way to fame on an old 2pianna,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-06.png	comes in with another of his own works: &quot;Parade of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-089/c04-089-07.png	Poppets&quot; (Columbia).
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-00.png	But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY'S Russ
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-01.png	Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-02.png	nothing crazy about his pianistics. He pounds merrily away
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-03.png	at a piece called "Piccadilly" (Polydor). I find it cute.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-04.png	American pianist Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on "It's
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-05.png	Now or Never," looks like having a success on his own with
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-098/c04-098-06.png	"On the Rebound" (RCA).
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-00.png	NEW boy on the vocal front is
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-01.png	Rolly Daniels, who comes 5,000 miles
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-02.png	from India to seek disc fame. Comedian Hal
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-03.png	Monty saw him in Bombay, became his manager.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-04.png	And such is Hal's faith that he brings him to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-05.png	Europe. Now Rolly gets his big break - a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-06.png	record, the modern Aladdin's lamp of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-105/c04-105-07.png	show business.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-110/c04-110-00.png	Become a success with a disc and hey presto! You're a star.... Rolly sings with

dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-03.png	frightening possibilities and yet by facing
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-04.png	them and knowing God is with us and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-05.png	that, with Him, there is nothing that can
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-06.png	finally defeat us. More than that, that God
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-07.png	has something important to do with our
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-08.png	lives and that the nearer we get to Him,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-020/d06-020-09.png	the stronger we become.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-00.png	Even more simply, test your own reactions
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-01.png	to different situations. There are some which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-02.png	bring on an almost immediate feeling of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-03.png	tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-04.png	the washing-up - while others, if they
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-05.png	refer to something you like doing, bring a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-06.png	veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-07.png	is 'too tired to help mum' will later jump
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-046/d06-046-08.png	up with no apparent tiredness at all when

dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-063/d06-063-03.png	to live a day at a time. Even those who

dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-00.png	A little more honesty, even if one refrains from going into
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-01.png	too many details, would help many a child to make a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-02.png	proper adjustment to life as it grows up. Let us look
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-03.png	at Jesus. We do not, I think, see there a life without fear.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-04.png	There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-015/d06-015-05.png	on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-00.png	Amen. MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-01.png	purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-02.png	partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-03.png	amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-04.png	effective, must be of that child-like quality which comes
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-030/d06-030-05.png	from innocence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-00.png	Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-01.png	until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-02.png	attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-03.png	with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-04.png	disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-05.png	of fatigue. They wonder why they get no rest at night,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-050/d06-050-06.png	even if they do sleep.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-00.png	If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-01.png	we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-02.png	staggered. Some of it is inevitable, and we do not want to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-03.png	become too pernickety. Nevertheless, we could all probably
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-04.png	be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-082/d06-082-05.png	through.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-00.png	The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-01.png	the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-02.png	plan and to the different public for which, or against which, the author wrote.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-016/d01-016-03.png	The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-00.png	There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-01.png	Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-02.png	present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-03.png	original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-04.png	accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-019/d01-019-05.png	could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-00.png	Most of those who expound a theory of textual
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-01.png	dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-02.png	written entirely by one author before the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-03.png	disturbance took place but a few leave it open
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-04.png	to suppose that the original book had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-05.png	revised even before the upheaval. The ingenuity
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-06.png	of the theories is impressive and is the best
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-024/d01-024-07.png	argument against them.

dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-03.png	how this enlargement was effected nor has he
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-04.png	been able to explain the textual movements by
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-05.png	showing that such changes are part of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-06.png	simple and coherent plan. To understand how
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-07.png	this is possible it is necessary to examine the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-049/d01-049-08.png	text of the Gospel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-00.png	THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-01.png	written in Greek. A modern text of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-02.png	Gospel represents the work of generations of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-03.png	scholars who have compared the many manu-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-04.png	scripts of John and worked out the version
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-05.png	which is most likely to have been the original
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-06.png	wording. It is not possible to establish any one
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-052/d01-052-07.png	text with absolute precision.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-00.png	The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-01.png	and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-02.png	a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-03.png	which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-04.png	this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-05.png	was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-06.png	an easy form of book in which to find a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-098/d01-098-07.png	reference.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-00.png	This last objection might have had some weight in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-01.png	ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13.11-12,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-02.png	the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-03.png	As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-04.png	overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-05.png	information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-06.png	The other form of book was the codex. In this the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-07.png	sheets were bound together down one edge much as
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-104/d01-104-08.png	they are in modern books.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-00.png	Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-01.png	might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-02.png	whether or not a particular text was written on
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-03.png	a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-04.png	writing, but any papyrus left unused at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-05.png	end could be cut off. If the text was longer than
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-118/d01-118-06.png	the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-00.png	The verso of the roll was blank, and one
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-01.png	cannot think of an author, Mark for example,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-02.png	sending out his Gospel lacking the ending,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-03.png	while one whole side of his roll was unused.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-04.png	The codex form was not so accommodating. Even
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-05.png	in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-06.png	sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-123/d01-123-07.png	over the binding, or the whole codex rebound.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-00.png	One can remember with horror the pictures of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-01.png	overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-02.png	complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantel-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-03.png	piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-04.png	numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-05.png	after the Victorian period that designers realised
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-06.png	the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-07.png	revived with designs suitable for contemporary
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-08.png	trends. Crochet today has a variety of uses, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-055/e01-055-09.png	has even stepped into the field of high fashion.

dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-02.png	The word is a Persian loan-word,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-03.png	pairi-deaza, from which our word paradise
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-04.png	is derived. Qoheleth has a second
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-05.png	paradise at his disposal but he is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-06.png	no happier than Adam was!
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-07.png	The word is used in the singular
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-112/d03-112-08.png	in Neh. 2.8 and S. of Sol. 4.13.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-00.png	A natural transition from gardens and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-01.png	orchards to the vital question of water
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-02.png	supply. The pools are probably natural springs
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-03.png	enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-04.png	the rock. King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-05.png	construction in lines 9, 23-25 of the Moabite Stone,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-06.png	which read: And I built Baal-meon and made
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-07.png	in it the reservoir... and I made both the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d03/d03-117/d03-117-08.png	reservoirs for water inside the town.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-00.png	According to the legend, Solomon had asked the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-01.png	Prince of the Demons, &quot;Ashmodeus&quot; to bring him
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-02.png	the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-03.png	Shamir had not been placed under his charge, as
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-04.png	there is no Shamir in Gehenna (Hell). An eagle
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-05.png	brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-06.png	the Paradise, the only place where the Shamir
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-005/d04-005-07.png	could be found.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-00.png	The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-01.png	a sanctuary, and only some rare birds know
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-02.png	the existence of it. These birds are, the Cherubim
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-03.png	and the Seraphim. We are also told that the Shamir
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-04.png	is the stylus used by Moses, and this stylus is described
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-008/d04-008-05.png	as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-00.png	The word Shamir was used as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-01.png	personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-02.png	word &quot;SHAMIR&quot; means guarded or preser-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-03.png	ved. Therefore, the real man, who
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-04.png	regards himself as insignificant, as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-05.png	prayer says: &quot;What am I? A worm&quot;, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-06.png	is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-07.png	the Shmah, loves the Lord God with
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-08.png	all his heart, and with all his soul and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-09.png	with all his might and studies the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-012/d04-012-10.png	word of God.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-00.png	This man is the worm, the creature that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-01.png	cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-02.png	a man is the Shamir that guards him-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-03.png	self against all the irrelevant pleasures.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-04.png	Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-05.png	to mould our character, to melt our
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-06.png	heart of stone. This Shamir helps
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-07.png	us earthly creatures to build an Altar
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-016/d04-016-08.png	for God to come nearer to God.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-00.png	The action of the Shamir writes books and their
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-01.png	books are readable. This Shamir is indeed a rare
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-02.png	diamond that incises the hardest rock, the hardest
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-03.png	facts. And these creatures existed from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-04.png	beginning. It is &quot;the stone, which the builders
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-05.png	refused, but it is to become the head-stone
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-06.png	of the corner&quot;. (Ps. 118, 22.) And the stone shall
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-021/d04-021-07.png	tell!
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-00.png	&quot;For the stone shall cry out of the wall&quot;, like
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-01.png	Baalam's ass, &quot;and the purlin of timber shall
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-02.png	creak in answer&quot; &quot;if the roof of our security is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-03.png	crushing our soul&quot; (see Hab. 2, 10-11). And it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-04.png	through the Shamir: &quot;That the earth shall be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-05.png	filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-028/d04-028-06.png	Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; (Hab. 2, 14.)
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-00.png	The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-01.png	which is written on two plates, the hard facts
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-02.png	of life, and all facts are &quot;one&quot;. We have all
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-03.png	come across human Shamirs and they leave
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-04.png	a deep impression on our feelings and senses.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-05.png	They make us the Altar for God to emit
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-06.png	the Light which can be read in every
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-07.png	language. The Shamir is the &quot;seventh&quot; and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-08.png	most important creature, that was created on
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-09.png	the eve of the Sabbath, to bring the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-032/d04-032-10.png	Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-00.png	Then the whole earth will be His Altar. &quot;And it
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-01.png	shall come to pass, if 1ye shall 1hearken
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-02.png	diligently unto my commandments, which I command
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-03.png	you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-04.png	serve Him with all your heart and with all
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-05.png	your soul.&quot; This may seem very good, but there
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-037/d04-037-06.png	is something deficient.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-00.png	Under such conditions without putting your
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-01.png	mind together we cannot solve the further
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-02.png	summons of destiny, to solve the economic
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-03.png	problems. Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-04.png	Jochai (Tanis 6a) &quot;if Israel does not fulfil
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-05.png	the wish of the Lord, failing to serve the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-06.png	Lord God with all their visionary power,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-07.png	the work will have to be done by each
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-047/d04-047-08.png	individual&quot;.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-00.png	Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-01.png	freedom from fear, fear of starvation in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-02.png	midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forth-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-03.png	coming for the people in need. They will
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-04.png	think of the animals first (which is of course
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-05.png	our duty). Of course the individual will
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-06.png	eat and be full but: &quot;Take heed to yourself,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-07.png	that your heart be not deceived, and 1ye turn
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-08.png	aside, and serve other gods, and worship them&quot;,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-09.png	the yourself is thy greatest enemy, the self-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-053/d04-053-10.png	seeking self.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-00.png	They will not work in union. If physical power, spiritual power
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-01.png	and visionary power is not united, man will remain in his heart
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-02.png	selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-03.png	gratify selfish aims, then each man will gather-in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-04.png	for himself only, instead of all to help to gather your
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-050/d04-050-05.png	corn, your wine and your oil.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-00.png	And you serve Mammon and God. And you cannot serve
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-01.png	two masters, and you worship self-interest, isolating
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-02.png	yourself, under such conditions the goods are your gods.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-058/d04-058-03.png	&quot;And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he

dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-06.png	ne through the mill, we need not teach them
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-07.png	to the children any more diligently and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-08.png	children will grasp now what will befall
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-066/d04-066-09.png	them without visionary power.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-00.png	And we will nail the Divine Law on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-01.png	door posts of the house and upon the gates.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-02.png	"That your days may be multiplied and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-03.png	days of your children in the land, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-04.png	the Lord swear unto your father to give them,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-05.png	as days of HEAVEN ON EARTH" That
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-06.png	means the Kingdom of Messianic Righteousness
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-071/d04-071-07.png	(Talmud Sanh. 99A).
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-00.png	The Messusah, which is nailed on the doorposts
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-01.png	contains those two lessons. The third lesson
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-02.png	of the Shmah (Numbers 15, 37-41) is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-03.png	called &quot;the going-out of the land of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-04.png	Egypt&quot;. It starts with the story of the fringes
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-05.png	the &quot;tsitsits&quot;. This lesson used to be read
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-06.png	only in the morning. And the Talmud tells a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-07.png	story, which is also in the Hagadah that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-08.png	Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said, &quot;I am
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-075/d04-075-09.png	nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-00.png	Ben Zoma said: "The days of 1thy life
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-01.png	means in the day-time; all the days of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-02.png	1thy life means even at night-time."
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-03.png	(Berochoth.) And the Rabbis thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-04.png	it important that when we read the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-05.png	Shmah "to be willing to hear," we
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-06.png	should remember the Great
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-07.png	Deliverance: Passover and its connection
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-081/d04-081-08.png	with the fringes (the tsitsits).
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-00.png	At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-01.png	was able to identify a photograph of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-02.png	girl, and he said he had last seen her
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-03.png	on platform six waiting to board
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-04.png	a train for the short run to Victoria.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-05.png	A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-06.png	a young lady &quot;as near as possible&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-07.png	like the photograph shown him, with
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-08.png	a man &quot;very close in conversation and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-093/f04-093-09.png	walking arm in arm.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-00.png	A guard reported that at East Croydon
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-01.png	he had seen what was accepted as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-02.png	same couple sitting close together in
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-03.png	a first-class compartment of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-04.png	train from London Bridge of which
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-05.png	he was in charge. The two could
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-06.png	have joined this train by taking
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-07.png	one from Victoria and changing
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-08.png	at East Croydon. He also believed
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-09.png	that they had still been together at
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-096/f04-096-10.png	South Croydon, and he remembered
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-00.png	Medical evidence established that Mary
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-01.png	Money had been dead for about an
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-02.png	hour before her body was discovered,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-03.png	and this matched reasonably well with
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-04.png	the timetable of the train in question.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-05.png	More important evidence came from a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-06.png	signalman at Purley Oaks, who had
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-07.png	seen, as the train passed his box, a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-08.png	couple struggling in a first-class
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-09.png	compartment; but he seemed to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-100/f04-100-10.png	been used to seeing couples engaged in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-00.png	And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-01.png	just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-02.png	are used on Passover, to depict the &quot;time of our freedom&quot;.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-03.png	And they are (1) Matzo; (2) Bitter Herbs; (3) Salt-water and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-04.png	Charauses (a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-05.png	appearance of mortar); and (4) an attitude to lean
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-086/d04-086-06.png	back.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-00.png	(1) Matzos is deficient bread, (LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew),
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-01.png	so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge, and to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-02.png	cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-03.png	to learn. Education is always the most important task.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-04.png	Education gives: Freedom of Speech. (2) Bitter Herbs
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-05.png	symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-06.png	We eat it. We accept it, to show we have self-control
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-089/d04-089-07.png	and that God dwells within us.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-00.png	Self-control gives us: Freedom to worship God. (3) Salt Water and Charauses:
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-01.png	the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-02.png	(MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew, Salt is the covenant of 1thy God,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-03.png	Levit. 2, 13.) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-04.png	ourselves and have peace with one-another. And the sweet
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-05.png	Mortar (the CHARAUSES in Hebrew) that binds all the &quot;hard-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-06.png	facts&quot; together and explains them, represents the Oral
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-096/d04-096-07.png	Tradition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-00.png	We dip into both, at the Seder. And we want to understand
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-01.png	more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition, our inheritance.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-02.png	Living the life of the Torah (&quot;dipping-in&quot;) makes us
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-03.png	meek: &quot;But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-04.png	delight themselves in the abundance of Peace&quot; (Psalm 37,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-101/d04-101-05.png	11). That gives us freedom from want.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-00.png	(1) Matzo represents Peshat; (2) Moraur
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-01.png	represents Remez; (3) Dipping-in represents
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-02.png	Derush; (4) Leaning-back represents Saud.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-03.png	(This is the PARDUS.) Matzo represents
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-04.png	the literal meaning of Pesach which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-05.png	is called: The Feast of Matzos. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-06.png	Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-07.png	principle and this gives us &quot;a wink&quot; (Remez)
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-08.png	how to live and accept all the bitterness
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-09.png	that is hurled against us. The Salt-water
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-10.png	and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-111/d04-111-11.png	the richness of the Law and that we should
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-00.png	Leaning back carries the concealed message. And we
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-01.png	start the Seder showing the Matzos, that they rep-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-02.png	resent the &quot;Bread of Poverty&quot; which our fore-fathers
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-03.png	were eating in Mitzrajim, to show they were willing to learn;
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-04.png	and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-05.png	discussions, saying: &quot;Anybody who is hungry, let him come
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-06.png	and eat, Anybody who is thirsty, let him come and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-117/d04-117-07.png	drink.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-00.png	And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-01.png	four ways of Israel's redemption. Hence &quot;four questions&quot;, which are
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-02.png	really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-03.png	demptions are asked at the Seder-evening about these &quot;four
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-04.png	symbols&quot; (the MANISHTANO). And the person who asks these
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-05.png	questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-121/d04-121-06.png	conducting the Seder.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-00.png	And we answer, that the Lord our God gave us &quot;four freedoms&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-01.png	without which Society cannot make progress. And we drink
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-02.png	&quot;four cups&quot; to thank the Lord our God for the &quot;four
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-03.png	freedoms&quot; which are Divine. There are four ways of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-04.png	redemption: (1) I will bring you out from under the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-125/d04-125-05.png	burdens of Egypt. (2) I will rid you of their bondage.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-00.png	(3) I will redeem you. (4) I will take you to me for a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-01.png	people. (1) I will bring you out from under the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-02.png	burdens of Egypt: How was it that Israel was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-03.png	brought out from under the burdens of Egypt?
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-04.png	Because, they kept the Passover and they were
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-05.png	eating Matzos in Egypt and the &quot;Feast of Matzos&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/d04/d04-131/d04-131-06.png	was known even to Abraham and Lot.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-00.png	The new century opened with James 1 ascending
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-01.png	the throne. He was quite prepared to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-02.png	tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-03.png	spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-04.png	James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-05.png	but those hopes were dashed. True, a new Prayer
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-06.png	Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-008/d05-008-07.png	derived little comfort from it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-00.png	This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-01.png	been the mood which produced the Black Rubric, for
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-02.png	it says that 'the Body and Blood of Christ, which are
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-03.png	verily and indeed taken and received by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-04.png	faithful in the Lord's Supper.' It could hardly be more
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-05.png	definite. It was at this time, too, that King James made
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-06.png	himself immortal by becoming associated with
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-07.png	a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-021/d05-021-08.png	(which was never actually authorized!).
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-00.png	In that year Shakespeare had just turned
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-01.png	forty and had written Hamlet two years
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-02.png	before. Bacon was at work and Milton was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-03.png	just learning to read. James was followed by
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-04.png	Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-05.png	Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-06.png	a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-07.png	became the foster mother of some of the most
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-08.png	important Prayer Books in the Anglican
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-025/d05-025-09.png	Communion.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-00.png	Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-01.png	now so much nobler a figure than former historians
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-02.png	led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-03.png	by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-04.png	mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-05.png	first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-06.png	the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-07.png	with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-030/d05-030-08.png	was necessarily a menace.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-00.png	They objected to the word Absolution. So the phrase 'or
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-01.png	the remission of sins' was added. But Absolution remained.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-02.png	They objected to the word Confirmation. So the phrase
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-03.png	'or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-04.png	able to render an account of their faith according
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-05.png	to the Catechism following' were added. But Confirmation
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-06.png	remained. Other changes in the Book were equally
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-07.png	minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-013/d05-013-08.png	added to the Catechism.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-00.png	Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church?
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-01.png	Laud made a positive approach. He set out to increase
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-02.png	a sense of reverence. The Prayer Book was to be respected
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-03.png	and so was the office of a bishop. Altars should be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-04.png	altars and not any broken down, transportable
dataset/iam_lines/data/d05/d05-040/d05-040-05.png	table which was handy for the most improbable uses.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-00.png	In the first place it is not a great deal
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-01.png	of use telling even children, as I have
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-02.png	already suggested, not to be silly or
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-03.png	to pull themselves together. Far better
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-04.png	to help them to face whatever it is that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-05.png	is worrying them, to find the original
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-06.png	cause and then deal with it; show it
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-07.png	up either for the sham it is - and many
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-08.png	fears are based upon completely
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-000/d06-000-09.png	irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-00.png	There may be some who will argue that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-01.png	routine destroys the soul. It is so easy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-02.png	they say, to get into a rut. Save us
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-03.png	from the school curriculum and even
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-04.png	worse the school system whereby for
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-05.png	meals everybody knows beforehand
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-06.png	exactly what, on any given day of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-07.png	week, they are going to have. If - such
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-08.png	a critic may say - you are calling
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-09.png	us to adventure, do not strangle us before
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-091/d06-091-10.png	we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-00.png	The effect of bottom congestion due to

dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-02.png	with that of the suitability of ground
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-03.png	for spawning. Both result in crowding,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-04.png	so there is no need to try to separate
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-05.png	them - thank Heaven! A good picture of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-06.png	this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-07.png	grounds from the Viking in the north down
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-006/e06-006-08.png	to the Klondykes and the Reef along

dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-01.png	has always differed from that of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-02.png	summer fisheries. There is the &quot;swim&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-03.png	at slack waters, even in daylight
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-04.png	sometimes; and the high swimming,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-05.png	when fish are caught only in the top
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-06.png	few yards of netting. These and other
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-07.png	fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-08.png	to this fishery, which unfortunately seems
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-09.png	to be dying out; but a full discussion of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-037/e06-037-10.png	them is beyond the present scope.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-00.png	The Bow-wave Theory. This assumes
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-01.png	that all fishing gear, when moving,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-02.png	sends before it a kind of scaring effect,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-03.png	probably through waves or vibrations in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-04.png	the water or along the ground.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-05.png	Underwater films suggest that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-06.png	footrope of a trawl does this. Films
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-07.png	have also shown plaice moving before
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-041/e06-041-08.png	a seine net in just the same way after

dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-01.png	dawn was given... And the thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-02.png	Was this: That a secret plan Is hid in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-03.png	my hand; That my hand is big Big,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-04.png	Because of the plan That God, Who
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-05.png	dwells in my hand, Knows this
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-025/d06-025-06.png	secret plan, Of the things He will

dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-00.png	In other ways, too, life for the ordinary
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-01.png	individual has become so complex
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-02.png	that it taxes the mind. Two hundred
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-03.png	years ago, men lived and worked
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-04.png	in one place, their lives were of one
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-05.png	piece. Now a man may live twenty,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-06.png	thirty even sixty miles from his
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-07.png	work. The only connexion is the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-08.png	pipeline of the railway on which they
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-067/d06-067-09.png	travel day by day.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-00.png	They only worked, of course, a five-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-01.png	day week so that in the first week
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-02.png	Monday to Friday were days one
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-03.png	to five of the timetable, the following
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-04.png	Monday was day six and Tuesday
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-05.png	started day one again and so on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-06.png	By this means they avoided each
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-07.png	week being the same with a pupil
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-104/d06-104-08.png	knowing exactly what the subject

dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-01.png	explains how these migrating herring
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-02.png	are biased to east or west by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-03.png	different winds. Strong westerlies
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-04.png	are well known to bring good
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-05.png	longshore fishings. The surface
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-06.png	water that is blown offshore must
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-07.png	be replaced by an underflow bringing
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-08.png	with it the herring to the Norfolk
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-026/e06-026-09.png	and Suffolk beaches.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-00.png	Let us consider first what would
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-01.png	appear to be the simplest case -
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-02.png	that of flat fish on the bottom.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-03.png	The evidence suggest that the fish are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-04.png	aware of the moving footrope before
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-05.png	it reaches them. They move away before
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-06.png	it, swimming at the same speed
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-07.png	for an unknown period of time, until
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-08.png	they become (1) tired, or (2) more used
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-049/e06-049-09.png	to the disturbance.

dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-02.png	nature knows better than we do, what it is to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-03.png	be really afraid, help us to know that when
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-04.png	we face life boldly, many of the shadows are
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-05.png	seen to be allies and not enemies and that,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-06.png	come what may, we are never alone when
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-027/d06-027-07.png	we are with Thee.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-00.png	They drag themselves around and can become
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-01.png	a burden to their families and their friends.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-02.png	Any mental confusion can cause this and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-03.png	the best way is probably to seek advice.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-04.png	As we are unable to cure our own bodies
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-05.png	if the cause of our pain is too deep seated,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-06.png	so we are unable to cure our own minds,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-07.png	if the trouble is a complicated one
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-056/d06-056-08.png	involving careful and patient treatment.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-00.png	I am more than conscious of this. How anybody
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-01.png	can go through the same routine day in and day
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-02.png	out for forty years I find difficult to understand.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-03.png	A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-04.png	commerce may be kept going - though if ever
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-05.png	it becomes possible to work out a system
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-06.png	of 'staggered' hours it may do an immense
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-07.png	amount of good over and above relieving
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-096/d06-096-08.png	the pressure on over-crowded trains.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-00.png	This could hardly happen without the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-01.png	herring having some orientation with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-02.png	sea bottom. It means that the crowding
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-03.png	is caused during the daytime, and that
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-04.png	the herring must continue to migrate over
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-05.png	the ground as well as in midwater and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-06.png	during the swim (the swim at East Anglia
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-000/e06-000-07.png	is always from the north).
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-00.png	So the arrival of any particular shoal
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-01.png	fish at a certain spawning ground may
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-02.png	be accidental. Yet there will always be some
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-03.png	that find it if enough are travelling, just as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-04.png	the robin who gets back exactly may be
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-05.png	only one among thousands who do not.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-06.png	But this southerly migration is not
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-07.png	accidental. Being contranatant or against
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-08.png	the drift, it probably has a survival value
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-09.png	in ensuring that the fry after hatching
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-021/e06-021-10.png	are drifted back into the normal home
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-00.png	To others, the long hours of the night bring
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-01.png	only a disturbed tossing and turning
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-02.png	which causes them to wake feeling worse
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-03.png	than when they went to bed. We may begin
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-04.png	to understand this a little better when we
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-05.png	realize that tiredness itself is largely in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-06.png	the mind. Very few people, under normal
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-037/d06-037-07.png	conditions, work themselves to a standstill.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-00.png	In many cases, their homes know little of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-01.png	their place of work and their associates at
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-02.png	the office or works wonder what they
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-03.png	are possibly like in the surroundings of their
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-04.png	homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-05.png	a 'double' life without ever deliberately
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-06.png	planning to do so or in fact being conscious
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-07.png	of what is going on. It is easier to live life in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-08.png	compartments but over the years it builds up,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-09.png	and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-072/d06-072-10.png	need to be handled correctly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-00.png	As it is, with so much of our life already
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-01.png	in a predetermined groove, I would
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-02.png	hardly like to add further to the dullness
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-03.png	which it engenders. But I am not arguing
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-04.png	for this. I know how much of a drag it can be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-05.png	and I was interested some little while
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-06.png	ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-100/d06-100-07.png	day timetable.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-00.png	Herring fishermen call this &quot;the outset&quot;. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-01.png	is strongest at spring tides, when without
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-02.png	wind you will &quot;set&quot; out - or drift to the east-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-03.png	ward, the length of half a fleet of nets -
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-04.png	almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-05.png	Knoll. Without an explanation of how it
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-06.png	works, it may well be that this outset, akin
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-07.png	to the mouth of a great salmon river, has
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-08.png	been the biggest factor through the ages
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-033/e06-033-09.png	in the constancy of this great herring fishery.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-00.png	Actually the seine net has little or no cover.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-01.png	And in this film the rise of the fish was
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-02.png	small, a matter of a foot or two. With round
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-03.png	fish like haddock, which would hardly
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-04.png	find safety on the bottom, this cover
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-05.png	would seem to be even more essential;
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-06.png	but more films are needed to prove this.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-07.png	Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-08.png	essential to catch round fish whose
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-070/e06-070-09.png	reaction to disturbance would be upwards.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-00.png	The mind tires first and conveys the impression
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-01.png	of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-02.png	noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-03.png	body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-04.png	a mother has news late at night that her
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-05.png	child is in danger. She will undertake a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-06.png	journey which, an hour before, she would
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-041/d06-041-07.png	have declared impossible.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-00.png	One of the greatest steps forward that has been
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-01.png	made this century is the way in which illness
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-02.png	of the mind is no longer feared or shunned,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-03.png	and is in fact no differently regarded than
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-04.png	physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-05.png	great deal of tiredness which comes from
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-06.png	no major complication but results from an
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-07.png	inability to deal with life, especially under
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-08.png	the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-060/d06-060-09.png	century.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-00.png	The housewife would find life far less tiring
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-01.png	if she made a list, followed a routine of work
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-02.png	rather than getting from one thing to the next.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-03.png	The business man would find that he reached
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-04.png	the end of the day with far less strain if
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-05.png	he was a little more systematic. To drift
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-06.png	aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-07.png	thing else. If we would only sit down and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-08.png	write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-09.png	be done and then work quietly through them,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-086/d06-086-10.png	we would find life considerably less exhausting
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-00.png	She will, in fact, be surprised at what peace
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-01.png	of mind ensues. (b) Concentrate on one
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-02.png	thing at a time. A list or a plan enables us to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-03.png	put all our energies into the particular
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-113/d06-113-04.png	matter on hand.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-00.png	Then they stop swimming and are caught. In
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-01.png	the seine-net film this usually seemed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-02.png	happen just after the fish had risen above
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-03.png	the footrope, and presumably out of its
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-04.png	field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-05.png	that the wave might be transmitted by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-06.png	sea-bed, though the footrope in this case
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-07.png	was actually just off the bottom and was
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-053/e06-053-08.png	indeed passing over some fish.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-00.png	Lucky indeed are the families that
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-01.png	possess a heritage of lace. A lace
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-02.png	bridal veil handed down from mother
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-03.png	to daughters, a lace-trimmed Christening
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-04.png	robe that each generation wears in turn -
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-05.png	these are proud possessions, linked to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-022/e01-022-06.png	exquisite lace-making of the past.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-00.png	But lace-making is by no means a lost
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-01.png	art. It suffered a decline and fell into
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-02.png	lamentably low standards in the fussy
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-03.png	over-furnishing of the Victorian age
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-04.png	but it would take more than a temporary
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-05.png	lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-06.png	viable craft. It has, in fact, readily
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-07.png	adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-08.png	ustrations in the following pages will show
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-09.png	how completely it is in sympathy with con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-025/e01-025-10.png	temporary surroundings.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-00.png	It will be seen how, with bold design
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-01.png	and rich colour, knitting, crochet and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-02.png	tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-03.png	can give striking individuality to many things
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-04.png	in the home. Chairbacks, cushions, tablecloths,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-05.png	to mention only three - how satisfying it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-06.png	to avoid the ready-made in these and by
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-07.png	one's own handiwork produce something
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-029/e01-029-08.png	that reflects true creative talent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-00.png	The more delicate patterns and finer
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-01.png	threads may be reserved to bring a light
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-02.png	and lovely touch to personal possessions -
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-03.png	a lace border to a handkerchief, fine-lace
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-04.png	insertion on a petticoat or blouse, a tatted edge
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-05.png	to a collar; these add a charming, feminine
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-06.png	distinction that nothing else can give.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-07.png	Although we assess lace-making as one of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-08.png	the feminine skills, a number of the well-loved
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-09.png	traditional patterns that we follow today were,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-032/e01-032-10.png	in fact, the brain-children of inventive men.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-00.png	For in the old order of things, men designed
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-01.png	and worked lace as well as women and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-02.png	special schools were set up to teach lace-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-03.png	making not only to young girls, but to little
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-04.png	boys as well. Whole families made their
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-05.png	livelihood by lace-making and consequently
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-06.png	a folklore of song, festival and courtship grew
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-035/e01-035-07.png	up around the lace industry.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-00.png	During the sixteenth century a considerable
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-01.png	amount of crochet was produced in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-02.png	convents of Europe. Without doubt it was the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-03.png	nuns who carried the craft to Ireland. There it
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-04.png	was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-05.png	form with rosettes, leaves and lace fillings. During
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-06.png	the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-050/e01-050-07.png	greatly abused.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-00.png	In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-01.png	hand-crocheted blouses, gossamer fine in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-02.png	texture, are sold at a very high price. With a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-03.png	little time and concentration the woman at home can
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-04.png	produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-05.png	Paris - a blouse, delicate gloves or a fine
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-059/e01-059-06.png	edging for collar, cuffs or a handkerchief.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-00.png	In the home, crochet lace can be used to make
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-01.png	tablecloths, traycloths and runners, and edgings
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-02.png	from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-03.png	functions. The art of crochet is not difficult and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-04.png	it is reasonably quick to work. In the following
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-05.png	pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-06.png	to enable the beginner to master all the essential
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-062/e01-062-07.png	crochet stitches.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-00.png	Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-01.png	Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-02.png	are of the utmost importance to the worker.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-03.png	It washes beautifully, never loses its colour
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-04.png	nor becomes 'stringy', is very elastic and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-05.png	preserves the beauty of the design. It is easy
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-06.png	to work with, soft, glossy and of uniform
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-092/e01-092-07.png	thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-00.png	Remember that texture plays an important part in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-01.png	the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-02.png	are more effective for the delicate designs used for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-03.png	tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-04.png	the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-05.png	chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-06.png	are made of steel, composition or bone. Steel
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-07.png	crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-102/e01-102-08.png	the largest, to number 8, the smallest.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-00.png	Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-01.png	size of thread. To ensure the correct results,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-02.png	it is important that you use the size of hook
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-03.png	specified in the directions. These are the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-04.png	correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet:

dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-06.png	piece for each stitch that you learn. When
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-07.png	you have become proficient in these
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-08.png	stitches, attractive articles can be made
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-107/e01-107-09.png	from the directions included in this book.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-113/e01-113-00.png	1. Grasp thread near end between thumb

dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-03.png	For although looking inwards (or &quot;introspecting&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-04.png	as it is called), is not entirely ruled out,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-05.png	nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-06.png	one of the most unreliable methods of getting
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-139/f01-139-07.png	any precise information.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-00.png	A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-01.png	imprisoned in England. His son, in revenge, was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-02.png	harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-03.png	and doing it to some purpose. John Philpot,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-04.png	one of that new class of merchant financiers

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-07.png	resources, and captured the young Mercer in a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-000/g01-000-08.png	brilliant Channel fight.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-00.png	For short ones a smoothing plane can be used.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-01.png	The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-02.png	on the newly planed surfaces, and these treated
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-03.png	as before. It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-04.png	the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-05.png	of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-014/e02-014-06.png	straight.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-00.png	A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-01.png	end reveals when the required amount
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-02.png	has been removed, and if care is taken
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-03.png	to stop the plane short of the squared
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-04.png	pencil line at the top, the work will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-05.png	accurate. The straight-edge can be used
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-018/e02-018-06.png	to test the straightness of the sides.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-00.png	Note that squared lines marking
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-01.png	the top member of the toe are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-02.png	needed as well as the upper ex-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-03.png	tent of the taper, and in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-04.png	this case it is necessary to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-05.png	mark in the line of the taper
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-06.png	with pencil and straight-edge
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-07.png	as at (B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-08.png	made at the upper toe line
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-09.png	exactly down to the taper line,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-025/e02-025-10.png	no farther.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-00.png	But why woodwork in particular? Well, there
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-01.png	are many reasons. Wood is in good and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-02.png	common supply; it lends itself to making
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-03.png	innumerable useful household items -
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-04.png	furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-05.png	it enables results to be obtained fairly
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-06.png	quickly; it is less expensive than most
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-07.png	other materials; it is a pleasant material
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-08.png	to work with; and, although it does
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-09.png	create a certain amount of mess, it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-074/e02-074-10.png	all clean and easily cleared away.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-00.png	This last point is certainly important because almost
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-01.png	everyone has come to recognise that machines
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-02.png	are not only an economic necessity, but that a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-03.png	great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-04.png	installation of a power tool. As an elementary
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-05.png	example, surely no one can pretend to enjoy
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-06.png	ripping out parts from hardwood. Most men
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-07.png	would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-082/e02-082-08.png	were available.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-00.png	Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-01.png	with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-02.png	most men have some of the tools already. It will enable
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-03.png	a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-04.png	any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-05.png	which other tools can be added as the need arises. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-06.png	nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-07.png	to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-08.png	which increases the range of things that can be
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-086/e02-086-09.png	made enormously.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-00.png	Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-01.png	machines, the choice of which will
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-02.png	depend partly upon the space available
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-03.png	in the workshop, the amount one
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-04.png	is prepared to pay, and the type of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-05.png	work a man normally does. First,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-06.png	however, a word of advice generally.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-07.png	Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-08.png	machines. They never are cheap in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-094/e02-094-09.png	long run. They may be inaccurate,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-00.png	Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-01.png	in design or quality soon become apparent. It is far
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-02.png	better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-03.png	quality, and not handicap yourself from the start.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-04.png	To put it in a slightly different way, do not allow
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-05.png	yourself to blame the tools when the job does
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-100/e02-100-06.png	not turn out quite right!
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-00.png	Many men with only limited accommodation
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-01.png	have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-02.png	Providing this is sound, some perfectly good
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-03.png	work can be done on it, but the usual problems
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-04.png	are those of the vice, the bench stop, and storage
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-05.png	place for tools. The combined bench top and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-06.png	tool cupboard shown here has been specially
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-07.png	designed and made for WOODWORKER
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-117/e02-117-08.png	readers who have this difficulty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-00.png	Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-01.png	timber as shown in Fig. 1. Although the timber will have already
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-02.png	been machine planed, remember to go over each piece with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-03.png	a smoothing plane, otherwise the marks left by the cutters
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-04.png	will show up after painting. The dimensions given enable the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-05.png	feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table, but the height
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-004/e04-004-06.png	can be altered if required.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-00.png	All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-01.png	which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-02.png	appearance. The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-03.png	each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses (C),
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-008/e04-008-04.png	cut to fit them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-00.png	See Fig. 2. These are then glued and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-01.png	pinned into place. A similar piece of 1 in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-02.png	by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-03.png	the end of the feeding tray as seen in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-04.png	Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-05.png	hardboard is covered with plastic material
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-06.png	for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-07.png	the frame with panel pins to complete
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-011/e04-011-08.png	the feeding tray.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-00.png	Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-01.png	fits up against the front legs of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-02.png	chair. The seat rests across the upper two
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-03.png	cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-04.png	glued and panel pinned in position, measurements
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-05.png	being taken directly from the work. Fig. 4
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-06.png	shows the framework for the back which
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-015/e04-015-07.png	is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-00.png	Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-01.png	screws driven from the inside. The footrest is a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-02.png	piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-03.png	by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-04.png	of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5. When determining
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-05.png	the position of the footrest, do not place too near
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-026/e04-026-06.png	the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-00.png	To complete the job, screw two fittings to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-01.png	inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-02.png	back to hold the baby's safety harness. These can be
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-03.png	made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-04.png	wire as shown in Fig. 6. Make sure that these
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-05.png	are well secured as they will have to withstand
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-030/e04-030-06.png	considerable pulling as the child becomes older.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-00.png	Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-01.png	with plastic wood. Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-02.png	framework and round off any sharp edges (such as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-03.png	edge of the seat, feeding tray, etc). Fill the grain with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-04.png	woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-05.png	a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-06.png	for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-034/e04-034-07.png	a suitable nursery transfer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-00.png	Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-01.png	if junior decides to bite the chair. Finally, it is as well
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-02.png	to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-03.png	material that might be available as otherwise the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-04.png	paint would soon be scratched off.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-05.png	(J.H.P.) BUILDING your own boat is a most
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-038/e04-038-06.png	satisfying and worthwhile project.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-00.png	Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-01.png	rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-02.png	sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-03.png	construction, cheapness and lightness of weight,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-04.png	and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-05.png	weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-06.png	and an outboard motor with a comfortable
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-043/e04-043-07.png	margin of freeboard.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-00.png	For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-01.png	in place of screws. We just bend them over and clamp
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-02.png	firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I've
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-03.png	always used brass screws, which are more expensive. The first
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-04.png	job is to make your moulds. In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-05.png	but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-052/e04-052-06.png	is nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked

dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-01.png	transoms to shape as in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-02.png	detailed drawings. If you have
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-03.png	a wooden floor you can use

dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-05.png	if not, use a strong horizontal

dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-079/e04-079-07.png	the ground or concrete floor. I

dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-00.png	The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-01.png	correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-02.png	Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-03.png	to allow for the chines to rest in these
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-04.png	notches, as they are not fastened to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-05.png	moulds, which will only be used whilst
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-083/e04-083-06.png	the hull is under construction.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-00.png	Dr. Davidson said he would go for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-01.png	a walk over the fields while we attended
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-02.png	to our business. To my amusement,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-03.png	when we met at tea at the rectory
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-04.png	after the Dedication, the Archbishop
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-05.png	said he had been stopped by
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-06.png	a farmer in a field. He seemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-07.png	rather indignant, but we took the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-003/g04-003-08.png	episode without a smile till afterwards.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-00.png	Nevertheless, average net family income
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-01.png	was appreciably higher in families with
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-02.png	several children than in those with only,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-03.png	many of which were incomplete families
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-04.png	of younger parents with lower earnings,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-05.png	and of course with lower tax reliefs and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-06.png	no family allowances. The rise in net family
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-07.png	incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-08.png	est for childless couples, especially older
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-000/h04-000-09.png	couples (probably because of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-00.png	'Are you enjoying yourself, Olimpia?' she
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-01.png	asked idly, tapping the girl's cheek lightly with
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-02.png	her fan, in passing; but she did not wait for
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-03.png	the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-04.png	was wondering whether Olimpia had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-05.png	watching her talk with Orsini. Surely she
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-06.png	could not have overheard anything they
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-07.png	said? A moment's reflection reassured her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-08.png	on that point, for she was certain no one
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-017/k04-017-09.png	had been standing near them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-00.png	The chine is the long stringer on each side which
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-01.png	is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-02.png	cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-03.png	ash, spruce or any long grained flexible wood. I
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-04.png	prefer spruce when available. As will be seen
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-05.png	in the plan, the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-086/e04-086-06.png	on each side.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-00.png	However, something inimical in the girl's look
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-01.png	put Vittoria on guard. 'Santa Maria! These spying
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-02.png	eyes!' she thought, bitterly. Doria was continually
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-03.png	stopping on the way, to point out, with childish pride,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-04.png	objects of beauty or interest. Vittoria, on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-05.png	fringe of the party, caught snatches of this
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-06.png	information, which held no interest for her:
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-022/k04-022-07.png	'... now this sapphire ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-00.png	The chines are morticed into this and butt up
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-01.png	against the transom. Start at the bow and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-02.png	spring them both at the same time over the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-03.png	slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-04.png	cut for this purpose in the stern or after
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-091/e04-091-05.png	transom framing. Glue, screw and make fast.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-00.png	The skeleton of the boat will now take shape,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-01.png	and this is the time to check before making fast
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-02.png	to see that nothing is distorted. Ensure that
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-03.png	the outside measurements from transom to transom
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-04.png	are equal on each side and that the transoms
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-05.png	are parallel horizontally. Next bevel the chines
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-095/e04-095-06.png	with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-00.png	Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-01.png	plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-02.png	planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-03.png	lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-04.png	purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-05.png	the other. If care is taken not to waste the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-099/e04-099-06.png	ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-00.png	While these may ultimately be made into a picture
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-01.png	for framing and hanging on a wall, they may
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-02.png	also be arranged into a design, and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-03.png	resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-132/e04-132-04.png	article.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-00.png	Having trimmed up the chines, we are now ready
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-01.png	to plank the sides. Start again at the bows,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-02.png	clamping into position with a 'D' clamp. Bend
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-03.png	round the frame to the stern and clamp there. If
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-04.png	you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-05.png	well. After generously covering with glue, screw
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-103/e04-103-06.png	the sides to the transom framing and the chine.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-00.png	Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws (brass) or nail
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-01.png	with inch and a quarter galvanized nails, if
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-02.png	you are doing it that way. Use flat head screws
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-03.png	about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-04.png	the 1/4 in. ply. Make a very small hole for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-05.png	the screw to allow for a good grip. Remember
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-109/e04-109-06.png	to glue before screwing.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-00.png	Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-01.png	which is cut in one piece. It should overlap just a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-02.png	trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-03.png	screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-04.png	necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-05.png	the screws. I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-06.png	the bottom, both for screwing to the chines and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-114/e04-114-07.png	the bottom shaped transom facing.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-00.png	Again, don't forget to glue. Now put on the keel and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-01.png	the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-02.png	the moulds. You won't want them again for this boat, so
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-03.png	shift them right out of the way. Place the boat right side
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-04.png	up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-119/e04-119-05.png	working.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-00.png	Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts (seats)
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-01.png	taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-02.png	with vertical members as shown in the plans. Make the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-03.png	four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-04.png	before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-05.png	a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside (gunwale)
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-124/e04-124-06.png	one to fit the block.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-00.png	I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-01.png	with copper nails and roves. It greatly improves the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-02.png	appearance and the strength. Paint with good marine primer,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-03.png	undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-04.png	WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-05.png	into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-127/e04-127-06.png	making fabric pictures or designs.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-00.png	Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it

dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-003/e07-003-02.png	and predators, is viewed with concern by a

dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-02.png	praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-03.png	eating other insects. Nine blowflies
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-012/e07-012-04.png	may be consumed at one sitting and

dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-05.png	at any rate, are light brown in colour.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-061/e07-061-06.png	Because of the cool, wet weather, I had great

dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-02.png	still in greatest demand. It is mostly
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-03.png	in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-04.png	have made headway, and although
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-05.png	numerous small clay pots are used each
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-06.png	year, they are fewer than they were 10
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-07.png	years ago. In the larger sizes there is still
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-08.png	no real substitute for clay that can be
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-09.png	obtained at a comparable price, except the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-10.png	bituminized paper pots which are used on
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-072/e07-072-11.png	commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-00.png	Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-01.png	pots for plant raising. These are compressed blocks of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-02.png	compost, made in a specially devised press to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-03.png	simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-04.png	Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-05.png	are made of the same compost as would have
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-06.png	been used in a pot, the # only difference being
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-07.png	that it is used in a slightly moister
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-094/e07-094-08.png	condition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-00.png	Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-01.png	in the normal way, the only real difference
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-02.png	being that more of the watering is done through a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-03.png	rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-04.png	of water. First-class plants of tomatoes,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-05.png	cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-06.png	celery and onions, may all be raised in soil
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-07.png	blocks; so can such flowering plants as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-08.png	dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-098/e07-098-09.png	lupins and numerous others.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-00.png	One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-01.png	one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-02.png	completely. Manufacturing the block and planting
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-03.png	it is very little more trouble than normal potting,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-04.png	and a superior plant, which transplants more
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-05.png	easily, is produced. The obvious limitation #
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-06.png	is that soil blocks can only be used for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-07.png	propagating; there can be no progression to a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-08.png	larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-09.png	to be moved; it must be planted out or
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-101/e07-101-10.png	potted.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-00.png	Many amateur gardeners might improve their
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-01.png	results by buying a small hand-operated soil
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-02.png	block maker and use the money saved on
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-03.png	buying small pots to improve their composts.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-04.png	The various types of small paper pots are very
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-05.png	useful for short-term operations, but are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-06.png	inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-105/e07-105-07.png	too long.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-00.png	They are # quite useful for plants that are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-01.png	despatched to market or direct to customers,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-02.png	their cheapness making them attractive to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-03.png	nurseryman; there is also considerable saving
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-04.png	in carriage costs because of their lightness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-05.png	There are many types of plastic pots available;
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-06.png	some expensive, some quite cheap; some good
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-07.png	and others not so good. A wide range of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-08.png	plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-09.png	usually need less water than those in clay
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-108/e07-108-10.png	pots.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-00.png	They are slightly more difficult to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-01.png	manage, however, until a little experience
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-02.png	has been gained with them. Plastic pots
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-03.png	are usually more expensive than clay ones,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-04.png	but they are almost indestructible and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-112/e07-112-05.png	will last a long time with normal care.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-00.png	The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-01.png	vocabulary to work on the existing store
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-02.png	so as to make it grow. He does not
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-03.png	simply pack new things into the store.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-04.png	The solitary learner has to find out
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-05.png	how to do this for himself, with the help
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-06.png	of books. He uses his vocabulary to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-07.png	ask questions and uses the books to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-053/f01-053-08.png	find the answers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-00.png	Thus learning how to learn means becoming
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-01.png	your own philosopher, your own psychologist
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-02.png	and your own teacher. You will then be
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-03.png	a well-established learner and the world
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-04.png	will be at your feet. Although the word
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-05.png	&quot;mind&quot; has given rise to endless
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-06.png	controversy among philosophers and psycho-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-07.png	logists, many of whom would like to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-08.png	abolish it from the dictionary, most
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-058/f01-058-09.png	of us obstinately go on using it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-00.png	And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-01.png	&quot;mind&quot; vanishes, at any rate for some time. It seems very difficult
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-02.png	to detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-03.png	surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-04.png	close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-05.png	word &quot;soul&quot; to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-06.png	essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-07.png	the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word &quot;mind&quot; for
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-08.png	the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-066/f01-066-09.png	are clearly associated with the brain.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-00.png	Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-01.png	picture of this &quot;basis&quot; of mental phenomena?
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-02.png	The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-03.png	with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-04.png	picture of the basis of such material phenomena
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-05.png	as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-06.png	gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-07.png	theories of &quot;mind&quot;? Are there any ultimate units
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-070/f01-070-08.png	of mind akin to the atoms of matter?
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-00.png	At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-01.png	be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-02.png	identified as elementary sensations. These were
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-03.png	thought to combine together to form compound
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-04.png	experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-05.png	matter combine to form molecular compounds.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-06.png	But this view led to too many difficulties and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-07.png	was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-08.png	for basic units of mind has gone on and will
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-09.png	doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-075/f01-075-10.png	discover ultimate units.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-00.png	We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-01.png	close analogy between the units of quite different
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-02.png	sciences. For example the success of the atomic theory
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-03.png	in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-04.png	units of geometry must be points. It would be more
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-05.png	correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-081/f01-081-06.png	geometry.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-00.png	There have been many conflicting tendencies in
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-01.png	psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-02.png	we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-03.png	concept which is current today. It is known as the schema.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-04.png	It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-05.png	concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-085/f01-085-06.png	but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-00.png	It is the tendency to get things
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-01.png	the wrong way round. As a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-02.png	psychologist I am constantly
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-03.png	encountering this tendency
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-04.png	in friends and acquaintances.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-05.png	They think there is something
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-06.png	inevitably &quot;queer&quot; about psychology
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-07.png	and this feeling of queerness
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-08.png	usually boils down to a quite
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-09.png	mistaken belief that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-135/f01-135-10.png	psychologist first looks into ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-00.png	And so they prefer objective methods. Since they cannot
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-01.png	directly look into the mental processes of another
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-02.png	person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-03.png	to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-04.png	this behaviour. This is no more queer than the method
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-05.png	of the doctor who observes signs, and records symptoms,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-143/f01-143-06.png	and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-00.png	He may never have had the disease himself but he
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-01.png	can nevertheless identify it. Similarly the psychologist has
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-02.png	to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-03.png	all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-04.png	correspond with anything in his own experience. We know
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-05.png	very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-06.png	provide our schemas, nor do we need to know as far as
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-07.png	psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f01/f01-147/f01-147-08.png	the neuro-physiologists.

dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-04.png	discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-05.png	plenary sessions. Of the men reaching fifty years of age
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-06.png	since the scheme started, 125 (37.2 per cent) have
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-020/f02-020-07.png	taken part.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-00.png	The original scheme was planned to provide short re-

dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-030/f02-030-02.png	the first of these is due in 1963. Meanwhile, each

dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-00.png	The Lord Provost, having studied the report on 'The Morale and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-01.png	Health of Retired Workers', and being satisfied that the matters
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-02.png	raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-036/f02-036-03.png	Glasgow and warranted further study, set an informal

dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-00.png	The large attendance and atmosphere of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-01.png	this Conference, held in October, 1957,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-02.png	reflected not only an increasing awareness
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-03.png	of the problems of men and women nearing
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-04.png	or already in retirement but also a strong
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-05.png	desire on the part of all concerned for
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-06.png	concerted action towards preparing men
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-07.png	and women for life in retirement and more

dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-038/f02-038-10.png	for those who are retired.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-00.png	As a result, the Glasgow Retirement Council came
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-01.png	into being in April, 1958, with Dr. Andrew Hood as
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-02.png	chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-03.png	Council has active committees on Education and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-04.png	Preparation for Retirement, and on Occupational
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-05.png	Centres. The former consists of representatives from
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-06.png	the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-040/f02-040-07.png	the Workers' Educational Association; the University

dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-00.png	In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-01.png	of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-02.png	to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-03.png	for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. An
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-04.png	approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-05.png	tober, 1959, the first experimental day-release course for
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-06.png	men was organised. Eleven students from seven firms atten-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-07.png	ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-08.png	to the men and their employers that the venture was an
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-09.png	experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-044/f02-044-10.png	as the participants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-00.png	1. Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-01.png	and retirement according to the occupational
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-02.png	level of employees? 2. If so, which occupational
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-03.png	levels are the better or the poorer prepared
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-04.png	for successful adjustment to retirement and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-05.png	in what aspects? 3. Does the evidence
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-06.png	obtained support a rationale for adapting
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-07.png	a pre-retirement planning and preparation
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-08.png	programme to the needs of older employees
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-076/f02-076-09.png	of different occupational levels?
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-00.png	Each time you rehearse you will probably put
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-01.png	things in a different way. All the better! - it will
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-02.png	sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-03.png	itself. Remember your four names - have the list
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-04.png	with you if you like - and you simply can't
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-05.png	be flummoxed! Of course, in any speech a good
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-169/f03-169-06.png	start and a good finish are half the battle.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-00.png	So - see the next page! Yes, they are waiting for you.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-01.png	But there is no need to be frightened. The audience
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-02.png	will eat out of your hand - if they like what
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-03.png	you offer them. A good start will put them in a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-04.png	good humour. Ladies and gentlemen! I'm afraid
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-174/f03-174-05.png	I have not had much experience of public speaking.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-00.png	But that's a terrible way to begin! Why tell them you
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-01.png	are a novice? It's their interest you want - not their
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-02.png	sympathy. And you want to get it from the word
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-03.png	GO! Try something like this: It is said that tele-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-04.png	vision keeps people at home. But you, at any
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-05.png	rate, have proved that wrong. And they say, too,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-06.png	that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-182/f03-182-07.png	intelligence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-00.png	May I suggest that you have proved that
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-01.png	right! Congratulations! And away you go into
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-02.png	your speech. Take some thought, too, for your ending.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-03.png	Thank you for listening to me so patiently. A political
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-04.png	candidate often used that finish. No wonder he
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-05.png	didn't get in! Instead he might have ended
dataset/iam_lines/data/f03/f03-191/f03-191-06.png	this way: Well, those are my views.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-00.png	When he learned what was causing the commotion he
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-01.png	became greatly alarmed, and after the body had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-02.png	taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-03.png	grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-04.png	Camp, aged thirty-three, the girl who was to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-05.png	been his bride. There was little doubt of how
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-06.png	she had met her death, and even less that it
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-004/f04-004-07.png	had been murder.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-00.png	The body was examined, and it was definitely
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-01.png	established that no sexual assault had taken place.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-02.png	It seemed probable that the motive had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-03.png	robbery, and this was further confirmed when a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-04.png	check was made with the woman's relations in
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-05.png	Hounslow. Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-06.png	Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. Her day
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-07.png	off was Thursday, and before coming up to London
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-08.png	in the evening she had called on her two sisters,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-09.png	one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-011/f04-011-10.png	other at Hounslow, where she kept a shop.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-00.png	Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-01.png	and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M., where
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-02.png	she had tea with her other sister, and then
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-03.png	went to catch the 7.42. Her sister saw her
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-04.png	to the station, helping her with some of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-05.png	her packages. This sister was able to establish
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-06.png	that she had carried a green purse and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-016/f04-016-07.png	had bought a railway ticket.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-00.png	She had been struck several times with a blunt
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-01.png	instrument, and her head was smashed in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-02.png	There were signs of a violent struggle, blood
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-03.png	on the cushions and floor, and the remains
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-04.png	of her broken umbrella. But a pair of bone
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-05.png	cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-007/f04-007-06.png	to provide the only possible clue to the killer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-00.png	The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-01.png	when the distance to the church deterred many from
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-02.png	coming to Sunday Evensong. We managed to furnish
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-03.png	a table with cross and candles, and the people
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-04.png	appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-05.png	as for more secular purposes. In 1910 Dr. Talbot
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-06.png	was translated to Winchester, and Dr. Hubert
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-007/g04-007-07.png	Burge became Bishop of Southwark.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-00.png	Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-01.png	work in connection with Higher Religious Education, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-02.png	to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-03.png	Union. This meant organizing lectures and courses of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-04.png	religious instruction through the Diocese, and I
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-05.png	also found myself a member of the Diocesan
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-06.png	Conference, where I remember introducing myself as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-07.png	the incumbent of the highest church in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-011/g04-011-08.png	Diocese.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-00.png	There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-01.png	some quarters, until I explained that my church
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-02.png	was 800 feet high above the sea level! The
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-03.png	work was growing pretty heavy, and we managed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-04.png	to get a stipendiary layman who could help
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-014/g04-014-05.png	among the children and young people.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-00.png	Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-01.png	me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-02.png	lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-03.png	continuing till old age to-day. When I went
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-04.png	to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-05.png	with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-06.png	and his family, the youngest of whose three
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-07.png	sons was just coming into the world in this year
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-095/g04-095-08.png	of 1913.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-00.png	The police began a systematic search of the line -
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-01.png	no easy task, but one in which patience and method
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-02.png	paid off. At a spot on the embankment between
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-03.png	Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-04.png	pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-05.png	sticking to it. The murder weapon, more than likely,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-06.png	and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-024/f04-024-07.png	killer to book in modern times.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-00.png	But in 1897, alas! there was no fingerprint bureau,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-01.png	no experts to check and photograph any 'dabs' it
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-02.png	might have yielded. It was a tough case to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-03.png	tackle, and Superintendent Robinson, of the L.S.W.R.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-04.png	Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of Scotland
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-05.png	Yard, combined forces in the investigation. While
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-06.png	accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-07.png	attacked for the sake of robbery, they did not
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-08.png	overlook the possibility that this might have
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-09.png	disguised another motive, and a thorough check
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-028/f04-028-10.png	of her former men friends and acquaintances began.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-00.png	They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, so-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-01.png	me well meant, some mischievous, including one that a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-02.png	man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-03.png	the Thursday evening, with blood actually dripping from
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-04.png	his hands. The inquest was opened on February 17, but,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-05.png	beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-06.png	the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-07.png	in which she had died, there was nothing on
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-08.png	which to proceed, and the inquest was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-032/f04-032-09.png	adjourned.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-00.png	Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-01.png	trails. It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-02.png	money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-03.png	a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-04.png	woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-035/f04-035-05.png	named Brown.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-00.png	This man agreed that his engagement had
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-01.png	been broken off after one particular
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-02.png	tiff, but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-03.png	money. All the while the police were casting about
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-04.png	for a man who had been seen leaving the train
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-05.png	at Wandsworth. A passenger described this individual
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-06.png	as a man of about thirty, of medium height, with
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-07.png	a dark moustache, and wearing a frockcoat
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-039/f04-039-08.png	and a top-hat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-00.png	The porter at the station bore out this
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-01.png	description, but the man was not traced.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-02.png	Perhaps the news of their search got around,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-03.png	for a man did obligingly present himself
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-04.png	at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-05.png	committed the murder - but he was mentally
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-06.png	defective, and, despite his claim to infamy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-043/f04-043-07.png	had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-00.png	Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-01.png	had at first been considered as belonging to the killer,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-02.png	proved yet another red herring, for it was learned that
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-03.png	they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-04.png	of her sisters. A young man from Reading named Marshall
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-046/f04-046-05.png	had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-00.png	This man was known to have left his home on February 11, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-01.png	to have been away for four days. Not in itself a crime, but, added to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-02.png	the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-03.png	dford for a false moustache, it left him with something to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-04.png	explain. His story was that he had left home to try to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-05.png	join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-049/f04-049-06.png	his military bearing), and this was accepted.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-00.png	And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-01.png	adjournments, until April 7, finally had to be content to return
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-02.png	a verdict of &quot;wilful murder against some person or
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-03.png	persons unknown.&quot; The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-04.png	pestle had been of no assistance. The killer must
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-05.png	have been very thankful that the science of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-053/f04-053-06.png	dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-00.png	The next female fatality occurred eight years later,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-01.png	yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-02.png	a further seven years before even a ghost of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-03.png	solution emerged. There has always been something
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-04.png	sinister in the idea of tunnels. The building of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-05.png	them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-06.png	nected with railway construction; and there
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-07.png	were many people who believed that to travel
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-08.png	through tunnels would be an equally
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-057/f04-057-09.png	hazardous business.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-00.png	Some thought that the result would be all
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-01.png	sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-02.png	confined atmosphere. &quot;The shareholders who travel
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-03.png	by it will be so heartily sick, what with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-04.png	foul air, smoke and sulphur, that the mention
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-05.png	of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-06.png	wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-061/f04-061-07.png	proposed to build the Box Tunnel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-00.png	The mere thought of subterranean travel
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-01.png	gave others a feeling of danger. A medical journal
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-02.png	said, &quot;the deafening peal of thunder, the sudden
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-03.png	immersion in gloom, and the clash of reverberated
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-04.png	sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-05.png	momentary shudder, or idea of destruction, a thrill
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-06.png	of annihilation.&quot; It was also prophesied that
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-07.png	passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-064/f04-064-08.png	darkness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-00.png	For all that, as far as England is concerned,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-01.png	there have been only two occasions on
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-02.png	which a body has been found in a tunnel
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-03.png	in circumstances pointing to murder.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-04.png	The first was that of Mr Gold, in the famous
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-05.png	Lefroy case, and by an odd chance the second tragedy
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-06.png	occurred on the same line, although this time the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-068/f04-068-07.png	victim was a woman.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-00.png	Though in the minds of most people there was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-01.png	no doubt that the woman had been the victim
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-02.png	of foul play, the verdict brought in was that there
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-03.png	was not sufficient evidence to show whether
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-04.png	she had fallen or been thrown from a train.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-05.png	The Merstham Tunnel, on the London-to-
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-06.png	Brighton line, is approximately one mile long,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-07.png	and some time before midnight on September
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-08.png	24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-071/f04-071-09.png	the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-00.png	It was the battered and broken body of a woman.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-01.png	He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-02.png	Station, and a stretcher party took the body to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-03.png	the Feathers Hotel to await identification.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-04.png	Was it a case of suicide, where some unhappy soul
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-05.png	had walked deliberately into the blackness and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-06.png	into the path of some train? This hardly seemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-07.png	likely, since, when she was examined by a local
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-08.png	doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-09.png	was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-10.png	almost tight enough to strangle her, and the ends
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-074/f04-074-11.png	thrust in her mouth like a gag.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-00.png	Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-01.png	and there were other injuries on her body which had
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-02.png	occurred before her death was ensured by some
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-03.png	train which had roared through the tunnel. There were
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-04.png	no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-05.png	fication, no money, and no railway ticket. By then
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-06.png	reports were being gathered about all traffic over
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-07.png	this stretch of line, but no information was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-08.png	forthcoming about any carriage with an open
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-09.png	door, nor any passenger reporting an incident
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-079/f04-079-10.png	which might relate.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-00.png	So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-01.png	long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-02.png	remained a mystery until later the following day.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-03.png	During that time a description of the girl was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-04.png	circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-05.png	identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-06.png	The girl, who was described as being &quot;always bright and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-07.png	jolly,&quot; had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-08.png	Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-083/f04-083-09.png	whom she worked as a book-keeper.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-00.png	On the Sunday, the day of her death, she had gone out in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-01.png	evening at about seven o'clock, telling her room-mate, Emma
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-02.png	Hone, that she was going for a walk, but would not be
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-03.png	gone for long. According to Miss Hone, she had not been
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-04.png	carrying a handbag, but she believed she had had a small
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-087/f04-087-05.png	purse.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-00.png	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-01.png	told us that there was nothing an Englishman
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-02.png	would not do; nothing an American would not
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-03.png	say; nothing an Italian would not sing; no
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-04.png	music to which the Frenchman would not dance;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-05.png	nothing the German would not covet; and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000b/f07-000b-06.png	nothing the Chinese would not eat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-00.png	It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-01.png	Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-02.png	the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-03.png	borrowed straight from the prehistoric. How
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-04.png	many centuries ago, in some cave or hilly
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-05.png	hide, did our forebears home from the chase
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-06.png	hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-07.png	meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-002/f07-002-08.png	homely and protecting flame.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-00.png	How many centuries later did the mercenary in
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-01.png	the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-02.png	evening meal. Later came the thrifty peasant,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-03.png	later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-04.png	in Paris, and even later our attractive young
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-05.png	ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-006/f07-006-06.png	gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-00.png	And, if certain dishes and modes of food have
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-01.png	persisted down the ages, the motive that preserved
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-02.png	them has always been the same. Apart from the need
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-03.png	for nourishment, the instinct of hospitality has
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-04.png	always been strong in mankind. The sharing of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-05.png	a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-06.png	admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-07.png	important than the casual meetings of the present
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-08.png	day; the desire to share something more intimate
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-009/f07-009-09.png	than mere converse has always been there.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-00.png	Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-01.png	procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-02.png	of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-03.png	grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-04.png	the dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-05.png	eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-06.png	intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-07.png	nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019a/f07-019a-08.png	monstrous.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-00.png	Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-01.png	water and food? The ancient Britons, I believe, used to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-02.png	make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-03.png	because their pots would not stand fire; but Jacob
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-04.png	must have had one that would, because Esau sold
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-05.png	his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-06.png	then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021a/f07-021a-07.png	which the Israelites sighed.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-00.png	Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have known any
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-01.png	way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-02.png	When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-03.png	was a grill, which he cooked himself, and he knew
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-04.png	how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-05.png	length subside, He throws a bed of glowing
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-06.png	embers wide; Above the coals the smoking
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-07.png	fragment turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024a/f07-024a-08.png	lifted urns
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-00.png	When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-01.png	fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-02.png	made rapid progress, because they were men of taste
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-03.png	and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-04.png	of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-05.png	confine the resources of the table to the gratification
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-06.png	of one sense alone. Having exhausted their invention

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-028a/f07-028a-08.png	they broke fresh ground and called another sense

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-00.png	By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-01.png	perfumes, these refined voluptuaries aroused the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-02.png	fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-04.png	board. The gratification of the sense of smelling
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-05.png	was a subject of no little importance to the Romans.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-06.png	They considered flowers as forming a very essential

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-01.png	a mingled shower of flowers and odorous
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-02.png	essences fell upon him; and one of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-03.png	recreations of Heliogabalus was to
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-04.png	smother his courtiers with flowers. Nor was
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-05.png	it entirely as an object of luxury that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-036/f07-036-06.png	ancients made use of flowers; they were

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-00.png	According to Pliny, and others, certain
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-01.png	herbs and flowers proved of sovereign
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-02.png	power in preventing the approaches of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-03.png	ebriety, or, as Bassius less clearly
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-04.png	expresses it, in clarifying the functions
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-05.png	of the brain. It is said that there is
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-06.png	nothing new under the sun, but regarding
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-07.png	foodstuffs the traveller occasionally
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039b/f07-039b-08.png	encounters a certain measure of novelty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-00.png	In China, for instance, dried rats are
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-01.png	esteemed a delicacy. The visitor is told
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-02.png	that they restore the hair of the bald
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-03.png	and that a stewed black rat will ward
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-04.png	off a fever. A number of newly-born
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-05.png	white mice served alive, dipped in treacle
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-06.png	and swallowed like a prairie oyster is
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042b/f07-042b-07.png	considered a piece of resistance.

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-04.png	So have the Japanese and the Chinese. The

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-06.png	it, press it and dry it, in which form, dusted
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-07.png	over with flour, you will find a stack of it
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046b/f07-046b-08.png	in almost any provision shop.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-00.png	Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-01.png	than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-02.png	activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-03.png	We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-04.png	one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-05.png	which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-069/f07-069-06.png	If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-01.png	Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-02.png	aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-03.png	fire, aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-05.png	celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-06.png	cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-07.png	and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured, sometimes
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-073/f07-073-08.png	Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-01.png	Londoners, but it brought heavy censure from nobles

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-03.png	leadership. But, at last, Gaunt sailed. Opposing
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-04.png	him was the French Admiral, Jean de Vienne -
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-004/g01-004-05.png	a great sailor and an able strategist.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-00.png	Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-01.png	trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-02.png	on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-03.png	an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-04.png	something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-05.png	the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-06.png	involved the dreary method of mining operations in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-008/g01-008-07.png	which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-02.png	set aside. A modern government needs
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-03.png	taxation not merely for defence and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-04.png	offence but for a very wide range of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-05.png	social services. A mediaeval oligarchy
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-027/g01-027-06.png	needed taxation in order to supplement

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-00.png	But this time there was a very interesting
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-01.png	attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-02.png	payments demanded. The definition of an
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-03.png	adult was altered to read 'over sixteen',
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-04.png	and, where the poorest were to pay a groat,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-05.png	the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-06.png	of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-07.png	and between these two extremes a graduated
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-08.png	scale of payments was fixed for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-067/g01-067-09.png	different classes of laymen and clerics.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-00.png	Again the resentment was widespread and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-01.png	the results disappointing - a tax estimated
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-02.png	to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-070/g01-070-03.png	In the following year, 1380, the last and

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-00.png	London was again in turmoil; but this time
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-01.png	over a question of trade rivalry. A rich mer-

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-03.png	John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was one of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-04.png	those charged with the crime. It is clear
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-05.png	from the chronicles that this was a sordid
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-06.png	quarrel between monopolists and interlopers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-074/g01-074-07.png	The city merchants were jealous of foreign

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-02.png	poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-03.png	three times the rate would produce 66,000.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-04.png	The only concession made in view of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-05.png	objections to the first two poll-taxes was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-06.png	the suggestion that the rich should help
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-07.png	the poor - but this was only a pious hope
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-08.png	because no machinery was provided for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-088/g01-088-09.png	carrying it into effect, and a subordinate
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-00.png	In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-01.png	from the dissection of living animals, showing how these move-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-02.png	ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-03.png	or in flagging warmer ones. At the time of its movement
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-04.png	the heart becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-05.png	its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-06.png	content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-059/g02-059-07.png	such as serpents, frogs, and the like.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-00.png	At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-01.png	of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-02.png	the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-03.png	contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-04.png	to the movement of the arteries, likewise gauged from
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-05.png	the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-06.png	contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-07.png	systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-08.png	and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-062/g02-062-09.png	ventricular content.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-073/g02-073-00.png	'And while the heart is slowly dying,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-073/g02-073-01.png	one can sometimes see it - so to speak
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-073/g02-073-02.png	- rouse itself and, in reply to two or
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-073/g02-073-03.png	three auricular beats, produce a single
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-073/g02-073-04.png	ventricular one slowly and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-073/g02-073-05.png	reluctantly and with an effort.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-00.png	Sentence Database
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-01.png	Yet in spite of the fact that his ideas did his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-02.png	business no good George would never conceal them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-03.png	He was a socialist and believed in the right
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-04.png	of the working class to control their own destiny, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-05.png	said so. Being a craftsman and a skilled man,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-06.png	George won many prizes, and though some people
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-07.png	would have nothing to do with him, others
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-08.png	would, and the comrades helped in many
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-000/g03-000-09.png	ways.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-00.png	Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-01.png	One of the helpful by-products was that
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-02.png	they were able to obtain some respectable
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-03.png	clothing, with which they wore a white tie
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-04.png	and Red Flag badge, thus presenting a much
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-05.png	better appearance. Later, on many a sunny Sunday
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-06.png	evening, when George went to speak at Malin Bridge,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-032/g03-032-07.png	they would be there to begin the meeting.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-00.png	As they became known the Choir went to working-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-01.png	men's clubs, to Conisborough on cheap trips to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-02.png	sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-03.png	as the Bakers' Union, for whom they went on Satur-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-04.png	day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-05.png	the members. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-06.png	on West Street, where a successful Sunday
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-040/g03-040-07.png	school was held.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-00.png	Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-01.png	to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-02.png	with them, particularly those who, like the Rev.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-03.png	Conrad Noel, the eloquent leader of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-04.png	the Church Socialist League, genuinely advocated
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-05.png	socialism. With such men, who had the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-06.png	courage of their convictions and their
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-049/g03-049-07.png	Christianity, common ground could be found.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-00.png	&quot;I know. Absurd as it may seem, I didn't want
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-01.png	you to think badly of me.&quot; She turned away
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-02.png	from him to fondle Judy, who, sensing something
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-03.png	amiss, was nudging her in the endeavour to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-04.png	gain her attention. &quot;The truth is that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-05.png	if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-06.png	time originally arranged, Sir John would
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-104/n02-104-07.png	have had it in for Guy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-00.png	You see, it was, apparently, through a mistake
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-01.png	on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-02.png	flamingoes our first morning on the island.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-03.png	&quot;What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-04.png	through Sir John's nonsense?&quot; Piers could
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-05.png	hardly have spoken with more contempt.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-06.png	A bully like that respects anyone who
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-109/n02-109-07.png	dares to stand up to him.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-00.png	Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-01.png	precisely the remark she had made to Guy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-02.png	She said icily, "As you pride yourself on
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-03.png	your knowledge of all the affairs of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-04.png	island I needn't tell you that Sir John
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-05.png	Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-06.png	important customers." "So what? You're not
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-07.png	trying to say that Hewson would victimise
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-08.png	Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-114/n02-114-09.png	courage!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-00.png	He's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-01.png	himself and his business to an unmention-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-02.png	able destination.&quot; &quot;There's a difference
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-03.png	between what a senior and a junior
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-04.png	partner can do,&quot; was her quick reply.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-05.png	&quot;What they can bring off! I'll admit that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-06.png	But Forrest might at least have tried. He's
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-120/n02-120-07.png	pretty spineless!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-00.png	&quot;You think you could have carried more weight
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-01.png	with Sir John?&quot; she enquired cuttingly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-02.png	&quot;For all your good opinion of yourself,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-03.png	I doubt it. He's about as easy to push around
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-04.png	as - as a grounded whale!&quot; He had to smile
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-05.png	at that, but went on airily, &quot;I'd have made
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-06.png	an attempt to show my lady-love that I
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-127/n02-127-07.png	put her interests before my own.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-00.png	His voice was like his black and pin-stripe,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-01.png	a grey superimposition of respectability over
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-02.png	the original colour of his own natural vowels,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-03.png	the result being somehow as ineffective, not
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-04.png	just dusty-grey but muddy, slimy even.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-05.png	His digressions too, seemed to have no other
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-06.png	purpose than the throwing of dust in his
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-07.png	client's eyes, the dust of fake security, of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-053/r03-053-08.png	the fake friend of the family, like the

dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-06.png	elections. In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-052/g03-052-07.png	Council meeting on October 16, 1912, George

dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-02.png	in the Labour movement, or of only providing
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-03.png	propaganda in order to increase the volume of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-04.png	socialist thought in the city, but sought to create
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-05.png	in the Labour movement a more militant attitude
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-06.png	capable of achieving socialism for the working
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-058/g03-058-07.png	people.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-00.png	Alf Barton, who in 1911 was presented
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-01.png	with a book on the life of Marx,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-02.png	and a gold purse in recognition of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-03.png	work for the movement, was later
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-04.png	known to say that it was not ne-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-05.png	cessary to understand Marxism in order to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-06.png	understand socialism, though at this time
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-064/g03-064-07.png	he was a keen member of the B.S.P..
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-00.png	The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-01.png	Lansdowne Road district, but I needed more help in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-02.png	church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-03.png	Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-04.png	1913 soon after I had come, and he organized the Mission
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-05.png	district and got to know, and be known by, many of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-060/g04-060-06.png	the people of the parish.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-00.png	A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-01.png	year, 1914, when war broke out. Very soon Chaplains for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-02.png	the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-03.png	that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-04.png	not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-05.png	for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-06.png	than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-07.png	was very soon in France where he did splendid
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-08.png	work until his health broke down and he had a bad
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-063/g04-063-09.png	attack of enteric fever.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-00.png	We gathered together a splendid Sunday
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-01.png	afternoon service at the church, each child
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-02.png	being given a number which, as they came into
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-03.png	church, they could just whisper to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-04.png	the superintendent who filled in the regi-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-05.png	ster at her own home. Each child had a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-06.png	picture given them and the lesson was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-07.png	largely based on this. It was on a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-08.png	stamp which could be stuck in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-09.png	their book, and there was quite a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-10.png	clamour for back stamps if a child
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-088/g04-088-11.png	had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-00.png	It was quite amusing to see how much
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-01.png	the children enjoyed the service, and I heard
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-02.png	of parents or faithful nurses threaten any

dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-04.png	allowed to come to the Children's Church
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-05.png	on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-06.png	kept them good in the week, but anyway
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-07.png	they were a most delightful lot, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-08.png	it is a great joy to meet them now
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-09.png	fifty years afterwards when so many
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-092/g04-092-10.png	are parents or even grandparents
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-00.png	From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-01.png	deep friendship which I have taken with me through
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-02.png	all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry. Mr. and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-03.png	Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-04.png	years of war, when most lives were upset and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-05.png	some tempers were easily frayed, the most
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-098/g04-098-06.png	loyal and devoted friends.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-00.png	Their homes - for since those years they have
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-01.png	lived on in Purley - have always been
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-02.png	havens of rest, and the welcome has never
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-03.png	failed. Their three boys, now successful men,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-04.png	were in our Children's Church from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-05.png	outset, and when we don't see one
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-101/g04-101-06.png	another we do not forget.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-00.png	In those early years 1914-18, life was very full
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-01.png	both in the parish and in the wider war activities.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-02.png	The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-03.png	Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-04.png	at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-05.png	I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-06.png	frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-07.png	the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-104/g04-104-08.png	someone who knew their native villages.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-108/g04-108-00.png	I could at once notice the great antagonism
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-108/g04-108-01.png	between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-108/g04-108-02.png	scorned these more simple country folk.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-00.png	Compared with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-01.png	showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-02.png	children and those with one child, and much smaller
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-03.png	changes for couples with several children. The quantity
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-04.png	index, which has risen only slowly since 1956, was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-05.png	almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-06.png	children, but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-07.png	households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-007/h04-007-08.png	couples and couples with one child.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-00.png	As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-01.png	more per calorie than the national average, and families
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-02.png	with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-03.png	substantial change was in families with three children,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-04.png	for whom the index declined from 91 to 88. Table 27
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-05.png	also shows the corresponding values of an index which
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-06.png	compares the prices paid by different types of household
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-07.png	for the commodities constituting the average household
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-021/h04-021-08.png	diet in 1959.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-00.png	Less than no response from the Russian side led
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-01.png	one to fear that the event might well have the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-02.png	outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-03.png	lead to disaster. Then there had been much talk of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-04.png	the setting up among the German population of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-05.png	general system of &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;, to be named
dataset/iam_lines/data/g05/g05-087/g05-087-06.png	&quot;Werewolves&quot;.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-01.png	Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-02.png	much as his health permitted him to enjoy anything.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-03.png	'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which is a great
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-04.png	resource. Vesuvius seems to be tired; he is going
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-05.png	out fast.... What a gay, lively people, and what
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-06.png	a busy town. At Rome, every other man was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-07.png	priest: here the priest is 1superceded by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-08.png	soldier - a favourable change in my eye, particularly
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011c/g06-011c-09.png	as the troops are very fine.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl back
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-01.png	to England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-02.png	late November, he was 'suffering as usual', but hoped,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-03.png	he told Arthur, 'to find this place agree with
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-04.png	me better than Naples. The journey has been
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-05.png	against me, as there has been much rain and damp,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-06.png	but the temperature is high & I have not
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018c/g06-018c-07.png	yet thought of a fire....

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026c/g06-026c-03.png	While he was writing this letter he heard of the fall

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-031c/g06-031c-06.png	must be had, will be a mass of Radicalism, & then

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037c/g06-037c-04.png	While he was in Naples there had opened a new
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037c/g06-037c-05.png	chapter in the history of Anglesey's unceasing search
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037c/g06-037c-06.png	for an effective alleviation of his painful malady.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037c/g06-037c-07.png	None of the numerous conventional remedies to which
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037c/g06-037c-08.png	he had been subjected ever since the symptoms had

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037c/g06-037c-10.png	had the slightest effect.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-01.png	the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to advise
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-02.png	Anglesey to give the system a trial, adding that
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-03.png	it was being cultivated with extraordinary success in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-04.png	France and Italy, and that he himself was being
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-05.png	treated under a doctor who had studied under
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045c/g06-045c-06.png	its founder, the aged Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-01.png	Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-02.png	later as 'more like a God upon earth than
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-03.png	a human being', had an increasing number of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-04.png	disciples among unorthodox medical men in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-05.png	cities of Europe. One of these was the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-06.png	Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047c/g06-047c-07.png	consulted in May 1834.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-01.png	master at Ko"then, near Leipzig, asking for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-02.png	advice. In doing so he described his distinguished
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-03.png	patient and his symptoms. He told Hahnemann
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-04.png	that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic man
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-05.png	with a gentle and charming character, even-tempered
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-06.png	and sedate, not easily irritated, patient and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-07.png	# persevering, 'but he appears to despair of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050c/g06-050c-08.png	ever being cured.'

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045j/g06-045j-02.png	written to advise Anglesey to give the system
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045j/g06-045j-03.png	a trial, adding that it was being cultivated
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045j/g06-045j-04.png	with extraordinary success in France and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045j/g06-045j-05.png	Italy, and that he himself was being

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047j/g06-047j-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047j/g06-047j-06.png	of Europe. One of these was the Neapolitan,

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047j/g06-047j-08.png	consulted in May 1834.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-01.png	master at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-02.png	advice. In doing so he described his distinguished
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-03.png	patient and his symptoms. He told Hahnemann
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-04.png	that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-05.png	man with a gentle and charming character,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-06.png	even-tempered and sedate, not easily
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050j/g06-050j-07.png	irritated, patient and persevering, 'but

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011k/g06-011k-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011k/g06-011k-01.png	Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011k/g06-011k-02.png	much as his health permitted him to enjoy
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011k/g06-011k-03.png	anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011k/g06-011k-04.png	is a great resource. Vesuvius seems to be tired;

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-01.png	master at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for advice.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-02.png	In doing so he described his distinguished patient and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050l/g06-050l-03.png	his symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-04.png	preserved. The papers were reopened in the

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-014/g07-014-06.png	in order to make sure that no recent will

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-00.png	It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-01.png	his copying. Considering that Pietro was not above
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-02.png	twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-03.png	of heavy responsibilities, his conduct reveals him as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-04.png	one of the most intelligent as well as the most
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-05.png	sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece. With
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-06.png	his good looks - for he 'carried the passport of a very
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-07.png	handsome person' - his good manners and his perfect
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-08.png	lack of pretension, he even succeeded in disarming
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-09.png	Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-00.png	She had loved Byron, but she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-01.png	betrayed him, betrayed him not twice, as

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-03.png	over a long span of time, fawning on his

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-05.png	the unguarded letters he never suspected
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-06.png	any eye but her own would see, feeding
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-07.png	the stealthy fires of her animosity: and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-08.png	having betrayed him, she had grown to fear
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-09.png	and almost to hate him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-00.png	She had dreaded his outpourings of affection
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-01.png	for her in poetry that he thought would clear
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-02.png	her and that only compromised her, and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-03.png	headstrong folly that tempted him to write on
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-04.png	ever more daring themes, teaching the world
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-05.png	to guess what repentance and unrepentance
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-06.png	preyed upon his thoughts.

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-05.png	suspected any eye but her own would see,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-06.png	feeding the stealthy fires of her animosity:
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-07.png	and having betrayed him, she had grown to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-08.png	fear and almost to hate him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-00.png	She had dreaded his outpourings of affection for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-01.png	her in poetry that he thought would clear
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-02.png	her and that only compromised her, and #
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-03.png	the headstrong folly that tempted him to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-04.png	write on ever more daring themes, teaching
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-05.png	the world to guess what repentance and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-028b/g07-028b-06.png	unrepentance preyed upon his thoughts.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-00.png	She had dreaded still more that he might
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-01.png	return to England, overshadowing her again
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-02.png	with spiritual and social peril. But this kind
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-03.png	of return was what she could never have
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-04.png	foreseen... that he # should come back not
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-05.png	voluble but silent, not beautiful but defaced,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-06.png	not in obloquy but with his praises ringing!
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-07.png	She could remember now his exciting laughter,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-08.png	his almost filial love for her, her almost
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-030/g07-030-09.png	maternal love for him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-00.png	Above all she could remember the anguish of their
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-01.png	parting, and how he had been 'convulsed, absolutely
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-02.png	convulsed with grief'. So love revived, and in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-03.png	its most sentimental form. While he lived
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-04.png	she had lost touch in her perpetual alarms
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-05.png	with what was best in him; dead his memory
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-034/g07-034-06.png	became sacred to her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-00.png	She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-01.png	# about biographies. Quite apart from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-02.png	divagations of her 'poor brother' - so she
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-03.png	constantly referred to him - there were a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-04.png	hundred reasons why it would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-05.png	objectionable to have the family history
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-06.png	exposed. Whatever latitude she allowed in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-07.png	the warmth of her kindly nature to others -
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-08.png	or to herself - she believed implicitly in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-09.png	the moral code she had learned from
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-038/g07-038-10.png	her good grandmother, the Countess of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-00.png	She had no desire to see in print that her
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-01.png	mother, who was to have been a duchess, had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-02.png	been involved in a scandalous and ruinous
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-03.png	divorce, that her father, 'Mad Jack Byron', was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-04.png	a profligate and a bankrupt who had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-05.png	squandered every penny two successive wives
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-06.png	had brought him and left the second on
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-07.png	the verge of destitution, and that he had died
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-08.png	a drunkard and perhaps a suicide, hiding
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-042/g07-042-09.png	in France to escape his creditors.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-00.png	It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-01.png	Leigh to share this kind of story with the world
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-02.png	than it would be for most 20th-century ladies
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-03.png	moving in court circles and having children to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-04.png	be settled advantageously in life. She had lived
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-05.png	down the rumours which had made the year of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-06.png	the Byron separation a nightmare to her, and she
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-07.png	had also succeeded, though with an increasing
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-08.png	sense of effort, in persuading her little world to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-09.png	avert its eyes from her husband, 'that drone',
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-044/g07-044-10.png	as # Byron called him, whose career of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-00.png	She had earned the right to be left in peace.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-01.png	Byron's fame was, of course, very wonderful, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-02.png	it carried with it too many reminders of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-03.png	terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-04.png	which she had never ceased to deplore, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-05.png	shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-06.png	his making friends with the atheist known to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-07.png	her as 'that infamous Mr. Shelley', and his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-08.png	mixing with really low and horrid people such
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-09.png	as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt, whom
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-047/g07-047-10.png	on would never conceivably meet in decent society.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-00.png	She was most emphatically opposed to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-01.png	production of sheer indelicacies, and that was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-02.png	the light in which she saw the proposed book
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-03.png	by Dallas. Letters between a mother and a son -
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-04.png	a son so outspoken and a mother so far from
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-05.png	suitable to be paraded before the public!
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-06.png	And brought out by that seedy poor relation,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-050/g07-050-07.png	Dallas! Could anything be in worse taste?
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-00.png	Hanson, the solicitor, was naturally remunerated
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-01.png	for his services, but all Mr Hobhouse's duties
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-02.png	as executor were performed without reward.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-03.png	And now there was more trouble brewing
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-04.png	with those unbearable Dallases. Dallas
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-05.png	senior was detained in Paris by severe
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-06.png	illness, but Dallas junior was full of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-07.png	fight and applying for the injunction
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-065/g07-065-08.png	to be lifted.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-00.png	He had gone to Byron's cousin, now 7th
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-01.png	lord, and had got him to compose an
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-02.png	affidavit to the effect that, whereas he
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-03.png	had formerly been reluctant to approve the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-04.png	publication unless it had first been
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-05.png	examined by the relatives and friends of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-06.png	his predecessor, he had now read the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-07.png	book and was content for it to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-08.png	issued without that precaution.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-00.png	There were few things in Augusta's whole
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-01.png	life, full of calamities though it was, that
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-02.png	hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-03.png	from George Anson Byron, whom she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-04.png	loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-05.png	on as her intimate friend. Moreover, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-06.png	was without the right to make such
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-07.png	pronouncements: he had inherited nothing
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-08.png	from her brother but his title, whereas
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-09.png	she was not only of nearer consanguinity
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-10.png	but the chosen recipient of his property.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-00.png	These, if she had only known it, were
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-01.png	precisely the reasons why her cousin took
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-02.png	pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-03.png	Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-04.png	intimate friends, and in every instance where
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-05.png	the occasion was granted her, she managed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-06.png	to find some excuse for bestowing, in whole
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-07.png	or in part, those confidences which never
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-08.png	failed to leave her audience agape with
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-09.png	wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-10.png	wickedness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-00.png	George Anson Byron had seen enough of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-01.png	the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-02.png	to be aware that Augusta, so far from
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-03.png	being responsible for the collapse of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-04.png	marriage, had been Lady Byron's greatest
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-05.png	support and comfort at the time; but it
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-06.png	had been deemed necessary all the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-07.png	same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-08.png	in the background, and he had repeated
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-09.png	them to his newly married wife.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-00.png	'Respecting the will', he wrote to Byron's widow a few days after
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-01.png	hearing its contents, 'the very thought of it is painful to me.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-02.png	What Mary has said about it is too true.' What Mary, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-03.png	new Lady Byron, had said about it was written on the first half
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-04.png	sheet of the same paper: My dearest Annabella, The more we
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-05.png	consider the most prominent subject in your letter, the more
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-06.png	we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-084/g07-084-07.png	connected with it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-00.png	Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-01.png	development corporations, about 20 per cent represents
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-02.png	extensions built after the firms had become established.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-03.png	It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-04.png	rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-05.png	sites; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-000/h07-000-06.png	for factory accommodation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-00.png	The average gross return on established industrial estates
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-01.png	ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-02.png	site works and buildings. Manufacturing industry affords
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-03.png	employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-04.png	manual workers. An analysis made by Crawley Development
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-05.png	Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from fifty-eight
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-06.png	manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-07.png	showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-08.png	managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as technical
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-003/h07-003-09.png	or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-00.png	There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-01.png	Crawley. The development corporations have aimed at a varied
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-02.png	pattern of industry, offering a reasonable choice of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-03.png	employer as well as choice of occupation for men, women and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-04.png	school-leavers, with due regard to the industries
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-05.png	already established in their towns. Inevitably engineering,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-06.png	including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-07.png	predominates in all the London new towns since these are
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-08.png	among the industries which have expanded most
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-007/h07-007-09.png	during the last ten years in the country generally.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-00.png	Of those at present employed in manufacturing industry
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-01.png	in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-02.png	employed in engineering and electrical goods manufacture -
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-03.png	the proportion employed in both these groups combined
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-04.png	varies from about 30 per cent in Welwyn to 85 per cent in
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-011/h07-011-05.png	Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-00.png	A new question asked about housing tenure, whether
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-01.png	the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-02.png	them as owner-occupiers; occupied in connection with
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-03.png	employment or as part of business premises; rented

dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-05.png	landlord (if so, whether furnished or unfurnished); or
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-06.png	occupied on some other terms. The analysis of private
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-07.png	households by size and various characteristics of their
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-024/h01-024-08.png	members has become increasingly important.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-00.png	The information collected under
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-01.png	this head will not affect the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-02.png	main count of population numbers,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-03.png	but will be used solely in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-04.png	analysis of households by size
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-05.png	and other characteristics. Sample. -
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-06.png	At an early stage of the census
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-07.png	preparations consideration was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-08.png	given to possibilities of reducing
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-030/h01-030-09.png	the amount of clerical work before ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-00.png	We have held eleven meetings. We decided as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-01.png	first step to seek information from a number
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-02.png	of organisations and persons having an interest
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-03.png	in the questions before us and at a later stage we
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-04.png	arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-05.png	anybody interested to submit representations. We
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-06.png	compiled a list of the points which we thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-07.png	were of importance, but we made it clear that
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-08.png	the replies need not be confined to these
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-004/h02-004-09.png	particular items.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-00.png	4. On examination of the evidence it became clear
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-01.png	to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-02.png	of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-03.png	were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-04.png	prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-05.png	or the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1956, and had
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-06.png	not so far been recommended for control as
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-017/h02-017-07.png	poisons.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-00.png	5. We recommended that, in general, any drug or
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-01.png	pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-02.png	central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-03.png	or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-04.png	on prescription and that an independent expert body
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-05.png	should be responsible for advising which substances
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-06.png	should be so controlled. 6. As an interim and urgent
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-07.png	measure, the Secretary of State for the Home Department,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-019/h02-019-08.png	on the recommendation of the Poisons Board, has
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-00.png	We are glad to note the action that has been taken
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-01.png	and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-02.png	that, as other preparations affecting the central nervous
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-03.png	system become available, they too will be brought to
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-04.png	the notice of the Poisons Board, or such other advisory
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-05.png	body as may in due course be appointed for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-06.png	purpose, to consider whether there are sufficient
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-07.png	grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-022/h02-022-08.png	on prescription.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-00.png	8. The second part of our Interim Report was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-01.png	devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-02.png	to the gases and vapours which they use in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-03.png	course of their professional duties. We
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-04.png	ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-05.png	ity was very small indeed. However, over a
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-06.png	period of eleven years, patients' lives had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-024/h02-024-07.png	endangered in two known instances.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-00.png	We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-01.png	subject that, with the apparatus at present to hand, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-02.png	preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-03.png	administering them to a patient was a recognised and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-04.png	necessary precaution. We accepted this. 10. In view of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-05.png	the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-06.png	anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-07.png	to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-028/h02-028-08.png	entrusted with their administration.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-00.png	The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-01.png	we were invited to review, were to advise on: (a) the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-02.png	circumstances, if any, in which the supply of morphine
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-03.png	and heroin, and preparations containing these substances,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-04.png	to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-05.png	as medically advisable; (b) the precautions which medical
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-06.png	practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-07.png	heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-08.png	administrative measures that seemed expedient to
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-035/h02-035-09.png	secure observance of those precautions.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-00.png	12. Through the system of records and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-01.png	inspection then in operation cases were
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-02.png	brought to the notice of the Home Office
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-03.png	at that time in which exceptionally
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-04.png	large quantities of morphine and heroin
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-05.png	had been supplied to particular practi-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-06.png	tioners or prescribed for individual
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-07.png	cases. On further enquiry it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-08.png	ascertained that sometimes the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-037/h02-037-09.png	doctor had ordered these drugs simply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-00.png	13. It appeared then that in some circumstances
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-01.png	dangerous drugs were being supplied in
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-02.png	contravention of the intention of Parliament
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-03.png	that a doctor should be authorised to supply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-04.png	drugs only so far as was necessary for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-05.png	practice of his profession. Before deciding on
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-06.png	measures to secure proper observance of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-07.png	the law, it was felt necessary to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-08.png	some authoritative medical advice on various
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-040/h02-040-09.png	aspects of the treatment of addiction, ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-00.png	The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-01.png	dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-02.png	and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-03.png	on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-04.png	later in this Report. They have, up to now,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-05.png	been included in the Memorandum on
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-06.png	the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-07.png	which is prepared by the Home Office
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-08.png	for the information of doctors and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-043/h02-043-09.png	dentists.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-00.png	Consumption by younger childless couples declined
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-01.png	throughout this period, but that of the smaller families was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-02.png	maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-03.png	families, particularly those containing four or more children,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-04.png	there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-05.png	1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated scales of family
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-06.png	allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-035/h04-035-07.png	milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-00.png	75. The smaller families and the residual groups of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-01.png	households containing children reduced their consumption
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-02.png	of sugar and of preserves, but in all other types of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-03.png	household a decline in purchases of the one was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-04.png	accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-05.png	76. Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-06.png	the previous year, but consumption was maintained
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-07.png	except in families with more than one child and in
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-08.png	the unclassified households with children or
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-049/h04-049-09.png	adolescents.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-00.png	All groups except families with four or more children
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-01.png	or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-02.png	vegetables, especially in the first half of the year, although most
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-03.png	reduced their consumption of other vegetables. Purchases of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-04.png	quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extreme-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-05.png	ly wide group differences persisted, the averages ranging from
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-06.png	0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-07.png	children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-08.png	households; average consumption by older couples and other
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-052/h04-052-09.png	wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-00.png	The two latter groups consumed much smaller
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-01.png	quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-02.png	bottled tomatoes than any other group, and much smaller
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-03.png	quantities of canned and bottled fruit than younger
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-04.png	childless couples; in households containing children,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-05.png	consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-06.png	increasing family size, but there was no regular
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-07.png	gradation in purchases of canned vegetables and canned
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-055/h04-055-08.png	tomatoes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-00.png	All types of household benefited from the improved
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-01.png	supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-02.png	with 1958, but the increase in consumption was
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-03.png	least in families containing children. 77. Total
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-04.png	bread consumption was virtually unchanged,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-05.png	although most types of household bought less
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-06.png	white bread and more rolls and speciality
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-07.png	breads than in 1958. Most groups increased
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-08.png	their purchases of puddings, cakes and biscuits,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-057/h04-057-09.png	but obtained less flour.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-00.png	78. Regression estimates of the expenditure on
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-01.png	different commodities attributable to the adult
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-02.png	couple and each additional child in a selected
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-03.png	group of households consisting of childless couples
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-04.png	(both under 55) and couples with different numbers
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-05.png	of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-06.png	the Annual Report for 1956. The younger childless
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-07.png	couples are broadly comparable in age and family
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-08.png	income with the family households, so that differences
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-09.png	in food expenditure may be associated with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-061/h04-061-10.png	presence of children.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-00.png	The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-01.png	but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-02.png	milk was reduced; since 1957 it has again declined. Most of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-03.png	average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-04.png	potatoes and milk; for fresh green vegetables, fruit, cheese, fish and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-071/h04-071-05.png	carcase meat, the incremental expenditure was slight.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-00.png	79. Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-01.png	the diets of households of different composition. The averages
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-02.png	showed little change compared with those for the previous year,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-03.png	except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-04.png	Since physiological requirements vary widely with age, sex
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-05.png	and level of activity, comparisons between families of different
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-074/h04-074-06.png	composition are only apposite when considered in relation

dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-01.png	comparison with allowances based on the recommendations
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-02.png	of the British Medical Association, are also shown in Table 30.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-03.png	In comparison with the previous year, changes were small
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-04.png	except for higher estimates for vitamin C. In families with
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-05.png	four or more children the levels of adequacy for all
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-078/h04-078-06.png	nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-00.png	For this fairly small group, comparisons between different
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-01.png	years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-02.png	defined number of children. In 1959 the households in
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-03.png	this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64)
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-04.png	than in the previous year (average 4.53). Their total food
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-05.png	expenditure increased less than that in other groups,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-06.png	and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-07.png	poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-08.png	biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are more
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-09.png	expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-10.png	they purchased less, namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-082/h04-082-11.png	meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat products.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-00.png	The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-01.png	guard on the jib of the crane, intended to
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-02.png	prevent direct contact with the line, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-03.png	electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-04.png	mounted slightly forward of the head of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-05.png	jib and with electronic assembly
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-06.png	and warning apparatus in the driver's
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-07.png	cab. Improved designs of both forms
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-079/h06-079-08.png	are being tried out at present.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-00.png	There is, however, a danger that workers
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-01.png	will rely too much on fixed devices because
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-02.png	they fail to recognise their limitations.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-03.png	It is therefore safer both in principle and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-04.png	practice to keep the worker away from
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-05.png	overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-06.png	(1) re-routing the line, (2) putting the supply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-07.png	underground, (3) making the line
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-08.png	dead (after consultation with the supply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-09.png	authority), (4) providing barriers at a safe
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-082/h06-082-10.png	distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-00.png	It is also important to remember that on
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-01.png	lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-02.png	from the line may take place without
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-03.png	actual contact. A new type of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-04.png	machine has recently been developed for
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-05.png	the automatic rolling of sole leather
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-06.png	bends. The sheet of leather is placed
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-07.png	on a sliding feed tray outside the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-08.png	danger zone and is then pushed
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-09.png	forward between two platens, the upper
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-085/h06-085-10.png	one carrying a set of small rollers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-00.png	The lower platen, which supports the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-01.png	leather, is raised hydraulically to bring
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-02.png	it into contact with the rollers on the upper
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-03.png	platen, which is then caused to make
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-04.png	several horizontal oscillations so that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-05.png	leather is rolled and pressed at the same time.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-06.png	The danger zone between the platens is fenced
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-07.png	by a guard which is interlocked with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-08.png	hydraulic valve and the press is also
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-09.png	sequentially operated: the closing of the shutter
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-10.png	starts the machine, the rest of the cycle
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-089/h06-089-11.png	following automatically.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-00.png	A new method of applying sand to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-01.png	faces of green bricks has recently been
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-02.png	developed. In the case of wire-cut bricks
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-03.png	the column of clay from the pug-mill is
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-04.png	carried by a short length of belt
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-05.png	conveyor to the sanding plant.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-06.png	This consists basically of a vibrating
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-07.png	hopper from which the sand is
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-08.png	distributed to all four faces by a
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-092/h06-092-09.png	system of slots, scrapers and worms.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-00.png	The conveyor is broken at this point to
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-01.png	enable the sand to be applied to
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-02.png	the under surface of the column, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-03.png	passes on through two pairs of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-04.png	vibrating rollers which embed the sand
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-05.png	firmly in the surfaces and is finally
dataset/iam_lines/data/h06/h06-096/h06-096-06.png	cut into bricks at the wire cutting

dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-00.png	All stages of Calanus, for example,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-01.png	seem to migrate on some occasions while
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-02.png	any stage may not on others. Such data
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-03.png	cannot yet be rationalized. Where
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-04.png	information is less extensive, however, it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-05.png	possible to find some regularity in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-06.png	observations. Thus in Euphausia superba
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-07.png	from the Antarctic, the metanauplii remain
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-08.png	in deep water, the later larval stages
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-09.png	migrate diurnally, and the adolescents
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-000/j06-000-10.png	stay permanently at the surface.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-00.png	The migrating stages all come from 100-250
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-01.png	meters, and the time of their arrival at
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-02.png	the surface is directly related to their
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-03.png	swimming capacity: 3rd (oldest)
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-04.png	calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr; 2nd,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-05.png	from 2200-0200 hr; and 1st, from 0200-0600 hr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-06.png	Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-07.png	in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-08.png	at the surface while the young migrate
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-005/j06-005-09.png	to and from a depth of 50 meters.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-00.png	Such permanent occurrence at the surface
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-01.png	could of course be considered the extreme
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-02.png	of a variable day depth. The effect of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-03.png	day depths upon the surfacing of various

dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-06.png	of migrational behavior, some kinds
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-07.png	of anomalies may be recognized.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-08.png	Vertical movement occurs in some forms
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-09.png	apparently in the reverse manner to
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-008/j06-008-10.png	that commonly met.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-00.png	Such reversed migrations are known for

dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-06.png	layer, which the authors think probably consists
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-07.png	of euphausiids, has also been described
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-08.png	as, in part, regularly moving in a reverse
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-09.png	manner. Most of these records are well
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-10.png	substantiated and involve whole populations
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-014/j06-014-11.png	rather than aberrant individuals.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-00.png	These figures are much higher than the national
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-01.png	averages, and may be thought to indicate a
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-02.png	lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-03.png	hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-04.png	skilled employment and are highly diversified
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-05.png	as regards products, markets and methods of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-013/h07-013-06.png	manufacture. Consumer goods industries such as the

dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-057a/h07-057a-00.png	This interest is likely to grow as employers become

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-00.png	Knowing the time of separation and the

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-02.png	of the bismuth-210 can be calculated. The

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-04.png	can be calculated from the known activity

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-06.png	yield, but this calculation is unnecessary
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-012/j04-012-07.png	provided the same lead carrier solution is

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-03.png	sulphate. Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-04.png	stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-05.png	is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-06.png	of the strontium sulphate is incomplete. Using
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-024/j04-024-07.png	ten milligrams of lead carrier and six

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-00.png	In the preliminary experiments, the tracer was added to a

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-02.png	strontium sulphate from hot solution. Chemical exchange
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-03.png	was complete under these conditions; but when the tracer
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-04.png	was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-05.png	stand for several days before the addition of lead
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-06.png	carrier, the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-039/j04-039-08.png	of the carrier.

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-00.png	The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-02.png	(lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve is shown in
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-03.png	Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-04.png	of resin used is also fixed. All available evidence indicates
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-05.png	that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-065/j04-065-06.png	of cross contamination apart from the natural

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-00.png	Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-01.png	interfere. Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-02.png	and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-03.png	the first wash. The resin is used for a single
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-04.png	separation and then thrown away. In the first stage
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-05.png	of the analysis, only the fraction containing
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-070/j04-070-06.png	lead-210 is collected. The lead is precipitated as

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-00.png	At the end of five days, bismuth-210 will have
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-01.png	reached one-half of its equilibrium value and
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-02.png	can be counted through an aluminium absorber
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-076/j04-076-03.png	sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-00.png	During the first few hours the curve will be
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-01.png	distorted if activity other than bismuth-

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-04.png	All but lead-212 will decay completely
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-05.png	within six hours. The decay of lead-212
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-06.png	will distort the observed activity for
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-07.png	hour and a half days if it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-080/j04-080-08.png	present.

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-02.png	by observing the decay curve. The removal of lead

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-05.png	exchange separation has been checked by
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-06.png	counting the trays. Not more than 0.2 of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-07.png	bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-094/j04-094-08.png	acid wash.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-00.png	This loss is acceptably small for an analytical

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-04.png	bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-05.png	also tested. Two samples of precipitated

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-07.png	were counted and dissolved in nitric

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-09.png	were evaporated to dryness with
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-098/j04-098-10.png	bismuth carrier and then taken up in
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-00.png	The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-01.png	phosphate. Results did not differ from those obtained by the more

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-04.png	rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-103/j04-103-05.png	Lead-210 when present in effluent is likely to be found

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-115/j04-115-00.png	A known quantity (approx. 1 x 10-2 15mc) of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-115/j04-115-01.png	lead-210 was added to 1-litre aliquots

dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-01.png	the cookie to make you a fresh lot?' 'I'd rather
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-02.png	have whisky,' I told him. 'Thought as much.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-03.png	Sun's nearly below the yard-arm, anyway.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-04.png	Wouldn't mind a stengah myself. How about
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-05.png	you, Harry?' So they had managed to come
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-06.png	to the stage of using each other's Christian
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-067/k02-067-07.png	names, I noted.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-00.png	Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-01.png	reserved as I thought. 'Thanks,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-02.png	Nigel,' he said. 'Just Coca-Cola.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-03.png	Although I'd like to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-04.png	whatever you have. I want to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-05.png	get to know the kind of life
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-06.png	people lead in the East, you know.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-07.png	At this, I felt a return of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-08.png	irritation I felt with him
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-076/k02-076-09.png	at times.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-00.png	Knowing Nigel, I would have been surprised if he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-01.png	had not made his usual 'arrangements'. A bachelor
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-02.png	himself, he knew well how to entertain his bachelor
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-03.png	friends. He caught my look and pursed his lips in
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-04.png	a quick little grimace of acknowledgement; then raised
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-093/k02-093-05.png	an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-00.png	I shrugged a shoulder. Lee would have
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-01.png	to decide about that for himself, I
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-02.png	thought, and noticed that although he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-03.png	was looking at the other girl, he did
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-04.png	so quite dispassionately, almost as though
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-05.png	he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-06.png	clothes she was wearing. And I thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-07.png	to myself: He may be still too much of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-08.png	a 'new chum' to see 'the beauty of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-097/k02-097-09.png	the East'.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-00.png	There was still an ease in our conversation, but its
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-01.png	scope was restricted. I felt that I could hardly make the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-02.png	usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-03.png	as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-04.png	wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-05.png	And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few drinks,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-06.png	then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-102/k02-102-07.png	dinner.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-00.png	He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-01.png	the floor. His pictures and curtains, indeed I
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-02.png	suppose the entire furnishings, had been se-
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-03.png	lected personally. The house was, as he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-04.png	occasionally proclaimed, his home - and he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-05.png	made it as such. I doubt if he will ever
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-112/k02-112-06.png	leave Malaya, even when he retires.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-00.png	The country, and his mistresses, have come
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-01.png	to mean too much to him. And, indirectly,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-02.png	this impression I had of him was one of several
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-03.png	reasons why I had decided I should leave
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-04.png	it - before, for me too, it would be too late.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-05.png	I used the excuse of our early start in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-06.png	morning to retire as soon as it seemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-07.png	prudent to do so, after the coffee and brandy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-08.png	already anticipating the familiar pleasures
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-117/k02-117-09.png	awaiting me.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-00.png	After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-01.png	grandchildren who had sat, rather intimidated
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-02.png	by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-03.png	Gibbons carving around the fireplace, rose
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-04.png	gratefully from the table, leaving the two
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-05.png	men together. A nurse came in, and asked
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-06.png	the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-07.png	helped out on to the lawn, but he waved
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-117/k03-117-08.png	her away impatiently.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-00.png	I don't mean just our direct military costs. I'm
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-01.png	thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-02.png	I'm afraid, Prime Minister, you're not going to like the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-03.png	trading position when you see it.' 'I never do,' the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-04.png	Prime Minister commented wearily. The Chancellor
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-05.png	was repeating an argument which he had already
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-138/k03-138-06.png	developed for an hour before lunch.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-00.png	'Only at yesterday's meeting - they're very restless, Prime
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-01.png	Minister. They feel that it's very old-fashioned - shooting
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-02.png	down mobs of natives. They're very much afraid that
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-03.png	if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-04.png	rather dismal stuff is going to come out.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-05.png	'Young back-benchers are always restive when they're
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-06.png	bored,' said the Prime Minister, and for the first
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-152/k03-152-07.png	time since his grandchildren left the table, he smiled.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-00.png	'Why don't you give them something to play with?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-01.png	'They've found their own toy,' said Ormston,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-02.png	'and this is it. They want to abstain next week.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-03.png	The Prime Minister continued in his flippant
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-04.png	tone, 'Tell the Chief to give them a
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-05.png	talking-to.' The Chancellor closed his eyes,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-157/k03-157-06.png	and then said,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-00.png	'I think it's gone beyond that, Prime Minister.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-01.png	They feel pretty strongly about Africa. They are greatly
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-02.png	disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-03.png	the Party which our African policy is creating.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-04.png	On the whole, the country is still in favour
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-05.png	of moderation and common sense. Melville has
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-06.png	in a curious way made us look old-fashioned
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-07.png	- extravagant - nineteenth centuryish -
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-164/k03-164-08.png	almost cranky.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-00.png	As he turned aside his head, since he could not
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-01.png	bear to look at her beautiful, pleading face, he was
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-02.png	suddenly attacked by suspicion. 'You wish to marry
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-03.png	someone else!' he cried in a voice roughened by
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-04.png	jealousy. She sighed deeply, and looked away. 'Do you?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-000/k04-000-05.png	Do you?' he repeated, fiercely.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-00.png	'Be careful,' she whispered from behind her fan.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-01.png	'Olimpia is watching us. The young man with her is
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-02.png	Orlando Cavalcanti, Francesco's friend.' Orsini
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-03.png	shot an impatient glance at the couple. 'The young man
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-04.png	with the mole?' 'Yes, indeed.' 'No matter. They are not
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-05.png	looking at us. Now I must know,' he whispered, 'what
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-06.png	you meant, cara mia. Do you want your freedom in order
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-039/k04-039-07.png	to marry?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-00.png	'If,' she said gently, giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-01.png	'if I wished to marry some young gallant, do you think I would
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-02.png	ask your help? You would be the last man I would ask.' Before
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-03.png	he could collect his wits to reply to this, there was a bustle
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-04.png	and confusion at the end of the room. Prince Doria had
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-05.png	wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-005/k04-005-06.png	coffer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-00.png	The party was now preparing to see
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-01.png	the tapestries, and in the general
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-02.png	movement, Vittoria was separated from
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-03.png	Orsini. Although neither of them
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-04.png	wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-05.png	no alternative. As she was about to mount
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-06.png	a wide and shallow flight of marble
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-07.png	stairs, she became aware of someone
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-08.png	watching her intently, and turning
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-09.png	in that direction, she saw Olimpia,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-010/k04-010-10.png	standing beside her admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-00.png	The young man was bending over her with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-01.png	assiduity of a lover, but the girl appeared to be more
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-02.png	interested in her cousin's wife, whom she was regarding
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-03.png	through half-closed eyes. This was a slight shock to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-04.png	Vittoria, who had forgotten the existence of the girl,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-05.png	and, up to this moment had been unaware of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-014/k04-014-06.png	young man's presence at the palazzo.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-00.png	I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-01.png	hair of the Empress Messalina, as she crouched
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-02.png	in terror in the gardens of Lucullus, awaiting the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-03.png	sword of the executioner.' 'Ah!' exclaimed
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-04.png	Farnese, with a snigger. 'The old cuckold
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-05.png	Claudius had the last word, after all. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-06.png	knew how to deal with an adulterous wife,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-028/k04-028-07.png	eh, Orsini?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-00.png	If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-01.png	not hear it. Now they entered the long gallery
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-02.png	where they dispersed and wandered around, admiring
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-03.png	and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-04.png	splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-05.png	back from Lepanto. After a short interval, Orsini
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-06.png	found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-07.png	'We must talk further,' he said in a low
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-033/k04-033-08.png	urgent voice. 'Where?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-00.png	Before replying to this, she glanced
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-01.png	hastily around, then spoke in tones so low that he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-02.png	had to bend his head to hear: 'I will never be
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-03.png	any man's mistress. As to marrying again ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-04.png	if I were free ... there is only one man I would
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-05.png	wish to marry ... but ... he, like myself, is now
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-050/k04-050-06.png	bound.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-00.png	With a swift gesture she closed her fan
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-01.png	and moved away from him towards the group
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-02.png	in the centre of the gallery, leaving him standing
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-03.png	alone, against that glowing, barbaric background,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-04.png	with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-05.png	On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-06.png	the visit to the Doria Palace, the cardinal's
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-07.png	coach left the villa, lurched over the unpaved
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-08.png	track and turned towards the ruined Baths
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-054/k04-054-09.png	of Diocletian.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-00.png	Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-01.png	way to the Accoramboni villa, ostensibly to pay
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-02.png	a daughterly call on her father, actually to coax
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-03.png	money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-04.png	debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-05.png	looked, and how cunningly the olive-green dress
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-06.png	with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-057/k04-057-07.png	perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more complex.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-00.png	The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-01.png	of Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-02.png	restless spirit, all threw into sharp relief the contrast
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-03.png	of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-04.png	her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-05.png	and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-06.png	to give her a separate establishment, he invariably
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-07.png	pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-061/k04-061-08.png	had built the villa for his family.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-00.png	She had, perhaps, demanded too much. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-01.png	kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-02.png	pected depths in her, and she knew that
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-03.png	if she yielded to him, her passion could,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-04.png	indeed, match his. Every instinct urged her to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-05.png	surrender, for there was that in his nature
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-06.png	to which her own had responded as it
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-075/k04-075-07.png	had responded to no other human being.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-00.png	Prudence, ambition and reason had
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-01.png	held instinct in check, and they must
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-02.png	dictate her course. There could be no
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-03.png	compromise. For a brief interval
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-04.png	she allowed herself the luxury of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-05.png	dreams. She began to imagine life at
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-06.png	Bracciano, the balls and fe*?5tes, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-07.png	conversation of poets and dilettanti. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-08.png	visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-09.png	ment, and herself on the ducal dais beside
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-079/k04-079-10.png	Orsini, placing a chaplet of roses on the brows
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-00.png	This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-01.png	sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop, nearly throwing
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-02.png	the two girls from their seats. Lucia uttered a cry of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-03.png	alarm. 'Look, madonna, we are surrounded!' It was true.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-04.png	Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-05.png	them and a lean, swarthy fellow was peering through
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-06.png	the window, grinning impudently. 'Santa Maria!'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-085/k04-085-07.png	shrieked Lucia. 'Banditti!'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-00.png	Vittoria now realized that they were outside
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-01.png	Santa Maria degli Angeli, and that except for a few beggars
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-02.png	crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-03.png	loathsome sores, the area was deserted. 'They are not banditti,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-04.png	Lucia,' said Vittoria, pointing to the badge on the man's
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-05.png	shoulder. The words were clear. 'Beware my hug!' Lucia
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-06.png	stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-07.png	averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-093/k04-093-08.png	of the retainer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-00.png	As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-01.png	could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-02.png	gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-03.png	gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-04.png	were left far behind. An old man belabouring an
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-05.png	overladen donkey, and a withered crone appeared
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-106/k04-106-06.png	on the horizon, were overtaken and forgotten.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-00.png	The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-01.png	the future would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-02.png	her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-03.png	hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-04.png	its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-05.png	was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-119/k04-119-06.png	French to Vittoria: 'Your maid ... is she reliable?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-00.png	Except for their escort, Vittoria and
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-01.png	Lucia might have been the only living
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-02.png	creatures on an empty planet. After the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-03.png	initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-04.png	knew exactly what she wanted, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-05.png	was prepared to take it without scruple,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-06.png	if she could. What she had forgotten
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-07.png	in her self-absorption in her own schemes
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-08.png	was that other people were equally absorbed
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-09.png	in their schemes, which were likely to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-110/k04-110-10.png	run counter to her own.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-00.png	This move today was a reminder of that fact.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-01.png	Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-02.png	the agitated Lucia, her brain was working
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-03.png	rapidly, and she decided that she must be
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-04.png	prepared to counter Orsini's demands,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-05.png	difficult though that would be. She became
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-06.png	aware that the pace was slackening;
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-115/k04-115-07.png	now the coach stopped.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-00.png	She shrugged her shoulders, and replied in the same
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-01.png	language: 'Yes. But make it worth her while.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-02.png	'I see. I know how to deal with people like that,'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-03.png	and turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-04.png	own language. 'Do you know who I am?' 'No,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-05.png	signor,' she whispered. 'I am the Orsini. My word is
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-126/k04-126-06.png	law in Rome.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-00.png	Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-01.png	Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-02.png	sombrely: 'Have you ever heard of a punishment called
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-03.png	the cord?' She blanched and shrank away. Was there not
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-04.png	a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-05.png	where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-06.png	sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-07.png	their arms were wrenched from their sockets. 'You have
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-136/k04-136-08.png	heard of it?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-00.png	The Orsini give that to traitors. There is
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-01.png	no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-02.png	a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-03.png	power can save him ... or her. Do you understand?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-04.png	'Yes, signor,' she faltered. 'On the other hand,' he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-05.png	continued, giving her a keen look, 'the Orsini are
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-142/k04-142-06.png	generous to those who serve them faithfully.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-00.png	Remember that, my girl.' Lucia was beyond
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-01.png	speech. He turned to Vittoria, sitting erect,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-02.png	with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-03.png	anger. 'And now, madonna,' he said smoothly, 'we will
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-04.png	continue the conversation started at the Doria
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-05.png	Palace. Be pleased to alight.' 'I think,' she replied
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-149/k04-149-06.png	coolly, 'I prefer to stay where I am.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-00.png	He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-01.png	led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-02.png	had never trodden. He learned how to use his
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-03.png	hands, how to adore that body without haste, how
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-04.png	to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-05.png	creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-06.png	himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-07.png	dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-08.png	his heart beat to a thunder.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-00.png	He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-01.png	her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-02.png	heart in the full throat. Her mouth did things he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-03.png	thought no human being could stand without
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-04.png	dying, but he went on living in an ocean of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-05.png	voluptuousness, that swelled and ebbed over him,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-06.png	under him, in him and through him...
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-00.png	He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-01.png	shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-02.png	a cigarette. His face was white with two red
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-03.png	blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely. O.K. teacher!
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-04.png	Was that any better? You know it was! You don't
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-05.png	need teaching, only a little coaxing.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-00.png	He sat down and ran his finger down along her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-01.png	spine. Do you love me now? Like yesterday! I'm
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-02.png	extremely fond of you. The fact that you're beginning
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-03.png	to satisfy my physical wants does not change that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-04.png	Before long you'll give me the satisfaction that'll set
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-05.png	me rocking on my feet, but I'll still be only fond of
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-077/k07-077-06.png	you. But you wouldn't marry me?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-00.png	No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-01.png	mean that. I'd very probably be unfaithful and
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-02.png	that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-03.png	you a lesson. It wouldn't work. You'd do it to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-04.png	spite me. I would never do it for that reason.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-05.png	To me it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-085/k07-085-06.png	or not. You'd go crazy if that situation arose.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-00.png	To observe the colour rise in her cheek
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-01.png	and hear her breath come faster, to see
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-02.png	the slight beads of sweat come out on
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-03.png	her glistening skin and see her move
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-04.png	with uncontrolled rhythm. To have her twist
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-05.png	in an attempt to receive a caress he was
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-06.png	purposely withholding, to hear her deep-throated
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-07.png	moan of full satisfaction and feel her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-122/k07-122-08.png	shivering, clawing surrender.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-00.png	Not so dusty, she might say afterwards, drawing at
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-01.png	a cigarette. It's a wow! he said. She kissed
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-02.png	him motherly: You just wait till you teach the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-03.png	girl you really love. He didn't protest any more
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-04.png	to say he loved her because he knew it to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-05.png	be untrue. Instead he said: Will that be
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-125/k07-125-06.png	better? She nodded:
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-00.png	It's man's nature to teach and to teach those
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-01.png	we love is double pleasure. And she
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-02.png	might add: And don't forget to leave the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-03.png	lights on. You lose half the fun when you
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-04.png	fumble in the dark. She had many direct
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-05.png	comments like that. Once she quietly
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-06.png	pushed him back when he kissed her too
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-134/k07-134-07.png	fully and too soon:
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-00.png	Oi, not yet, you oaf. What do you think my
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-01.png	mouth is? A billposter's bucket to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-02.png	plunged in at random? He'd learned to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-03.png	laugh when something went wrong or the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-04.png	situation became ludicrous, as when they
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-05.png	were both caught in the raw when he'd
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-06.png	forgotten to lock his door and Derek
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-141/k07-141-07.png	had walked in unexpectedly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-00.png	They'd just had time to nip into the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-01.png	bathroom and stood there shivering for
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-02.png	fifteen minutes while their guest was
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-03.png	smoking a cigarette waiting for him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-04.png	At last Derek got tired and left.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-05.png	Just in time, erupted Charlie. If he'd
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-06.png	stayed any longer I'd jolly well
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-07.png	have asked him to join us. I'm so
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-146/k07-146-08.png	darned cold I could do with two men.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-00.png	One of the small ones. Sark, that's it. The Caxtons
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-01.png	used to have their holidays there. Starmouth went
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-02.png	there. He dug out some people who remembered
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-03.png	the family. In the end he pieced it all together.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-04.png	The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-007/l01-007-05.png	Pete first met them at school.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-00.png	It was a good school I sent him to, one of the best.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-01.png	He was a boarder. He could always turn on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-02.png	charm when it suited him. The whole family
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-03.png	came to like him. The real Michael - he was the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-04.png	same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-05.png	was eighteen. Soon after that Pete staged his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-016/l01-016-06.png	drowning.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-00.png	He was always a smooth liar. He invented some
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-01.png	plausible story or other and threw himself on
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-02.png	the Caxtons' generosity. They accepted him as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-03.png	kind of substitute for the boy they had lost.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-04.png	Outside the family he began to pass himself
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-05.png	off as Michael Caxton. The father was well-off
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-023/l01-023-06.png	and easy-going. He was easy meat for Pete.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-00.png	My chance had come at last. I had to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-01.png	take it. I was going to smash him as
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-02.png	he had twice tried to smash me. (His
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-03.png	eyes, wild and frightened, were fixed on
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-04.png	Tong. Tong guessed that they did not
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-05.png	see him.) I told Starmouth to go at
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-06.png	once and report exactly what he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-07.png	seen to Dackson and his daughter.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-050/l01-050-08.png	He did as he was told.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-00.png	&quot;Another was the body fetching up on the mooring-hook - practically where
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-01.png	it started from.&quot; &quot;And you finding out about the spy at the Marshams',
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-02.png	&quot; Passon said. &quot;Just a stroke of luck, sir,&quot; Tong said. &quot;Luck or not,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-03.png	Harry, it was the real turning-point for us. Must be true what they
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-082/l01-082-04.png	say. 'Tong can't go wrong!' &quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-00.png	When Nick returned home he found that his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-01.png	mother was seriously ill. She had pneumonia. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-02.png	sight of her youngest son, the doctor said, was the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-03.png	only thing that saved her; it gave her the strength
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-04.png	she needed to fight for life. Soon she was out of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-05.png	danger, but the doctor told Dan that she would
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-06.png	have to remain in bed for some time and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-07.png	that thereafter it was essential that she should
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-095/l01-095-08.png	not have to exert herself.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-00.png	With Grace helpless Rose set up her
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-01.png	own autocracy. Her squeaking, querulous
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-02.png	accents were heard without inter-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-03.png	mission. They rose over the baby's inter-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-04.png	minable howling and were directed at
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-05.png	everyone in equal measure. She was
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-06.png	a poor and unpunctual cook. Normally
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-07.png	indolent, she was now and again seized
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-08.png	with unpredictable bouts of energy in
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-09.png	the grip of which she swept through
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-105/l01-105-10.png	the house with a fury that disarranged
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-00.png	Only the old man's room was too much for
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-01.png	her. Once she put her head round the door,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-02.png	and Sam shouted: &quot;You get right out of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-03.png	this, Rose. You leave me in peace.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-04.png	Rose took one breath of the stagnant air.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-05.png	&quot;You - you polecat!&quot; she screeched, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-06.png	retreated without argument. Her re*?
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-07.png	2gime, hated alike by all the men,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-111/l01-111-08.png	produced one extraordinary result.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-00.png	One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-01.png	about to enter the house. Fred grasped his brother's elbow.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-02.png	&quot;Nick, I can't stomach this much longer.&quot; &quot;Nor me. What's the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-03.png	answer? Mum's picking up, but she'll never be her old self
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-04.png	again.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-05.png	&quot;That First Flower's driving me nuts,&quot; Fred said. &quot;I'm going to put
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-06.png	a stop to it.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-119/l01-119-07.png	&quot;What with - arsenic?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-00.png	Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother, beckoned
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-01.png	him to stand closer, and whispered into his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-02.png	ear the most unexpected words Nick had
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-03.png	ever heard. &quot;I'm going to get myself
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-04.png	married,&quot; Fred said. The next day he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-05.png	brought home a woman in her middle
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-06.png	thirties and took her straight to his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-129/l01-129-07.png	mother's bedside.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-00.png	"Mum, this is Maggie. I'm going to marry her,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-01.png	and I'd like her to come and live with us."
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-02.png	Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-03.png	smile, a placid nature, and a slow-moving
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-04.png	but methodical mind. For twenty years she
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-05.png	had worked in the bottling-store at the bre-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-06.png	wery, and Grace heard with astonishment
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-07.png	that Fred had known her on and off
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-133/l01-133-08.png	for nearly as long.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-00.png	It was Nick who found the answer. &quot;Only
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-01.png	one thing for it, Mum,&quot; he said, sitting on
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-02.png	the edge of the bed and holding one
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-03.png	of her hands in his. &quot;Let Fred and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-04.png	Mag have the two upstairs rooms
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-05.png	between them. Sam will have to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-143/l01-143-06.png	come out of his kennel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-00.png	He propped himself on one elbow. &quot;You can't
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-01.png	do it to me, Nick. I've worked this room up to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-02.png	my way of thinking like I'd educate a child.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-03.png	This room and me understands one another.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-04.png	&quot;Sam,&quot; Nick said firmly, &quot;either you and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-05.png	me share downstairs, and we have Mag, or
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-06.png	you stick it out up here and we all get
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-173/l01-173-07.png	saddled with the First Flower for ever.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-00.png	Sam sank back on his pillow. &quot;Oh, my
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-01.png	God! All right, you win!&quot; With that settled
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-02.png	Fred was soon married. The First Flower
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-03.png	snatched up her infant and departed, mut-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-04.png	tering sarcasms. The whole household
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-05.png	listened to the dwindling screams of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-06.png	baby with relief. Maggie soon proved her
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-07.png	worth, and after a time Dan summed up
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-179/l01-179-08.png	the general approval by saying:
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-00.png	&quot;She's as good a worker as you could wish for.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-01.png	She speaks our language. Mag's one of us.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-02.png	Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-03.png	amicably. The old man, though fighting a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-04.png	grumbling rearguard action, permitted himself
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-05.png	gradually to become a little cleaner and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-06.png	tidier. In his heart he was well satisfied to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-07.png	have Nick's company. When they were alone
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-08.png	together he often explained all over again
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-09.png	how shrewd he had been in discovering
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-187/l01-187-10.png	Alf Jesty's secret.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-00.png	"It certainly was, Sam," Nick would agree, and go
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-01.png	on to say with a touch of self-importance: "No
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-02.png	wonder he tried to have me suffocated back
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-03.png	last summer. Must have thought I'd
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-04.png	rumbled him right from the start." By this
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-05.png	time Nick was certain in his own mind
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-06.png	that he had really seen Caxton's hand
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-07.png	snatching at the prop holding the barge's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-08.png	hatch open, though he could never prove it,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-09.png	and it would not be of much use if
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-199/l01-199-10.png	he could.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-00.png	The nose is one of the most pain-sensitive
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-01.png	organs in the human body - and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-02.png	Malone was discovering the truth in
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-03.png	scientific detail. Kennan had only
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-04.png	seconds left. He jumped forward to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-05.png	the far limit of his chain, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-06.png	right hand chopping edge-downwards
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-000/l03-000-07.png	in bone-jarring force.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-00.png	The blow took the writhing thug a fraction
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-01.png	above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-02.png	plexus, the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-03.png	Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-04.png	combat targets. The thug collapsed with a whistling
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-05.png	moan, and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-06.png	suddenly limp hand. There was no time for
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-07.png	rejoicing, but the hard, firm shape of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-08.png	automatic sent a new confidence surging through
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-004/l03-004-09.png	his body.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-00.png	Shouts, and the clatter of feet meant
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-01.png	Goldie and Leo Grundy were on their
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-02.png	way. Kennan pulled the manacle chain
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-03.png	taut, and blasted two shots at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-04.png	link which tied him to the ring-bolt in
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-05.png	the rock. The nine-millimetre bullets sma-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-06.png	shed the chain as if it had been plastic,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-07.png	and, free, though the chain still dangled,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-08.png	he threw himself across the floor
dataset/iam_lines/data/l03/l03-008/l03-008-09.png	towards the entrance.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-00.png	'Well, what do you think?' she scoffed, her
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-01.png	brilliant eyes challenging him. He made no answer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-02.png	There was nothing to be said. He lifted his glass
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-03.png	and drained it, feeling the sweat breaking out on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-000/l04-000-04.png	palms of his hands.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-00.png	When at last he looked up she was standing right
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-01.png	in front of him, smiling as if nothing had happened!
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-02.png	He could hardly believe it and blinked several times.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-03.png	'Well, don't I get a drink tonight?' she asked boldly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-04.png	'Of course... anything you like', he murmured,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-05.png	relief flooding over him. 'Kitty... I'm sorry....'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-005/l04-005-06.png	His throat went tight and words failed him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-00.png	'Aw, forget it', she said cheerfully. 'I'll sting
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-01.png	you for a double for being a naughty boy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-02.png	How about the telly tomorrow afternoon?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-03.png	He felt a glow of happiness steal over him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-04.png	Everything was all right now, thank God. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-05.png	wasn't going to break with him, after all.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-06.png	For the moment it was the only thing in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-012/l04-012-07.png	world that mattered.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-00.png	'Of course, Kitty', he said fervently, his eyes misty
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-01.png	behind their thick lenses. 'Well, I'll be off now. See you
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-02.png	tomorrow... and thank you....' 'So long, Bob', she said,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-03.png	waving her hand to him. Harry followed him to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-04.png	door, opened it for him and stood outside on the step,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-05.png	looking up at the sky, where a few pale stars shone
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-020/l04-020-06.png	between puffs of light cumulus cloud.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-00.png	'Nice night', he remarked affably. 'But they forecast rain
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-01.png	for tomorrow.' 'Do they?' Bone glanced up at the sky, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-02.png	thoughts elsewhere. Personally, he didn't care if it rained cats
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-03.png	and dogs and he knew that Harry didn't either. He waited,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-04.png	pulling on his gloves and adjusting his hat. 'Look, Bob,'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-05.png	Harry began, after a brief silence, 'I don't mean to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-06.png	butt in, but if you take my advice you'll 'ave no
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-026/l04-026-07.png	more truck with 'er.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-00.png	He jerked his thumb over his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-01.png	shoulder. 'That girl's nothing but a load
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-02.png	of trouble, I'm warning you.' 'Kitty's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-03.png	all right', Bone contradicted flatly. 'It's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-04.png	her boy-friend that's the trouble. If
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-05.png	we could get rid of him...' Harry
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-06.png	nodded his grizzled head like an old
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-07.png	hound. 'You're right there, Bob', he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-034/l04-034-08.png	muttered. 'But it's easier said than done.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-00.png	Kitty encourages him, too. No work, no
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-01.png	background, no regular money so far as I
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-02.png	can make out. Probably on the crook.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-03.png	But there you are, the girl's wild and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-04.png	headstrong. I can't do nothing with 'er.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-05.png	'Don't worry, Harry', the other said quietly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-06.png	'I won't make a fool of myself.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-07.png	Kitty needs a good friend and I'll
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-043/l04-043-08.png	always be that.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-00.png	He paused, hatred of Stevie Hewitt
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-01.png	rising like gall in his throat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-02.png	'And I'll find a way of getting rid of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-03.png	that chap, Hewitt, too. Leave it to me.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-04.png	'O.K., Bob, but watch your step. He's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-05.png	a tough customer, mark my words', Harry
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-06.png	said in a low voice. Bone half smiled
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-07.png	in the darkness. 'I'll remember', he said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-052/l04-052-08.png	'Good night, Harry.' 'Good night, Bob.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-00.png	Bone walked down the road, his cre*?
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-01.png	5pe-soled shoes making no sound
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-02.png	on the asphalt surface. As he walked
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-03.png	he concentrated on the problem of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-04.png	Stevie Hewitt. By comparison with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-05.png	manner in which he had dispatched
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-06.png	Henry Mansell the elimination of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-07.png	little spiv from Brighton seemed an
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-08.png	easy undertaking... once he'd set
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-062/l04-062-09.png	his mind to it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-00.png	Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-01.png	it beside the fire in the living-room, his thoughts once
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-02.png	more on Kitty. If she was really in love with Stevie
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-03.png	Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-04.png	told himself moodily. Yet it was not as clear-cut as that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-05.png	He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-06.png	of the necessity to help and protect her, even against
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-066/l04-066-07.png	her will.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-00.png	Tonight, for the first time, he had abandoned all
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-01.png	pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-02.png	for her. She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-03.png	him. In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-04.png	a bond between them. No doubt she had every intention
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-05.png	of keeping both of them on a string. On the whole he probably
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-06.png	had a slight advantage over the young man, inasmuch as he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-07.png	had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-071/l04-071-08.png	respect for the material things of life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-00.png	Sentence Database L04-082
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-01.png	But he was still no sort of match for a young
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-02.png	and virile competitor and he knew it. He turned
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-03.png	away and begun to undress, shivering with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-04.png	cold. His eye automatically glanced towards the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-05.png	panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-06.png	secret treasure. For an instant he stood
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-07.png	transfixed to the floor, his eyes unwavering
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-082/l04-082-08.png	as they riveted themselves on the wall.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-00.png	Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided?
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-01.png	Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-02.png	panel and pulled it out. The black tin box was exactly
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-03.png	as he had left it. With heavily beating heart he reached
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-04.png	out and lifted the lid. Everything was intact and he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-087/l04-087-05.png	gasped with relief.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-00.png	He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-01.png	to count them. Of course, he remembered being in a great hurry to get
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-02.png	that fifty pounds for Kitty! Obviously he had been careless in
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-03.png	replacing the panel, but the possibility of anyone having
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-04.png	discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-05.png	As he replaced the bundles of notes, he withdrew the tin
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-06.png	box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-093/l04-093-07.png	cupboard.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-00.png	It would be safer under lock and key
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-01.png	for the time being than behind a piece
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-02.png	of panelling which did not fit very sec-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-03.png	urely. Tomorrow he would buy a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-04.png	heavy padlock for the box and search
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-05.png	for a new hiding-place. He lay in bed,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-06.png	cold and uneasy, unable to account
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-098/l04-098-07.png	for an instinctive sense of danger.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-00.png	When he closed his eyes it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-01.png	Henry Mansell's face he saw, hovering
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-02.png	above his head like a hideous caricature. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-03.png	parrot nose and straight line of the mouth,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-04.png	the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-05.png	him right down to his abjectly quaking
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-06.png	bones. The mouldering horror that had
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-07.png	once been Henry Mansell taunted him
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-102/l04-102-08.png	now in the silent darkness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-00.png	In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-01.png	Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-02.png	Dowell drank their beer and waited. 'It's too damn busy
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-03.png	in here. We can't expect him to leave his customers',
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-04.png	Hugh said morosely. 'Give him a chance, old chap.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-05.png	He'll be over. Jim's a most reliable chap when
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-106/l04-106-06.png	it comes to picking up a small tip.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-00.png	'O.K., Roddy, whatever you say.' Hugh drained his glass and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-01.png	ordered two more beers. 'I'm really beginning to feel it's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-02.png	all a bit of a waste of time, anyway. I've been collecting
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-03.png	scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-04.png	months now, and the whole lot still doesn't amount to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-113/l04-113-05.png	anything one could call concrete.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-00.png	Roddy puffed at his pipe, his eyes fixed on the white-coated
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-01.png	barman. 'Oh, I think it does, Hugh. That's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-02.png	why I want you to meet this bird. I think
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-03.png	he fills in an important part of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-04.png	background. Furthermore, dear boy, it confirms
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-05.png	what we already know of your father's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-06.png	intention to leave the country on the night
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-118/l04-118-07.png	of October 14th.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-00.png	Hugh nodded. His face wore the melancholy expression
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-01.png	that was habitual to him but his eyes showed
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-02.png	his inner excitement. 'I know, but from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-03.png	moment he walked out of here we haven't a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-04.png	shred of evidence to prove what happened.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-05.png	Obviously he met someone, either by chance or
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-06.png	by arrangement. Whichever way it was, that
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-07.png	person had a gun and he managed to persuade
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-08.png	Father to drive along that quiet stretch of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-124/l04-124-09.png	road....'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-00.png	'Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-01.png	Lydd', Roddy interposed quickly. 'And once there he was
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-02.png	shot at close range and his money smartly filched.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-03.png	You know, whoever it was might have known of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-04.png	existence of the suicide letter... providing him with
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-05.png	an almost unshakable alibi.' Hugh was thinking of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-06.png	his uncle, but said nothing. After all, Julian had
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-07.png	acted very strangely since the tragedy, always
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-08.png	secretive, always reluctant to discuss his brother's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-130/l04-130-09.png	death.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-00.png	It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-01.png	cold-blooded murder but, in fact, Henry Mansell's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-02.png	death had saved the firm and Julian's future.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-03.png	Moreover he might well have been aware of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-04.png	brother's intention to skip out of the country and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-05.png	passed on the information. 'I'm sure you're right',
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-06.png	Hugh said thoughtfully. 'But whoever did it got
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-136/l04-136-07.png	clean away without being spotted.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-00.png	'Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-01.png	believe me', Roddy affirmed solemnly. 'He probably caught
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-02.png	the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-03.png	with the money somewhere.' Hugh nodded. 'I realized that
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-04.png	after my talk with Mrs. Lawford. There are a dozen countries
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-05.png	where a man could easily hide up and change the money
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-141/l04-141-06.png	without danger.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-00.png	Unless we can get a definite line on him it's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-01.png	hopeless....' 'Something will turn up one day, you'll see',
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-02.png	Roddy said confidently. 'If we plug away at the leads
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-03.png	we have....' 'If only the police would do something...' Hugh
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-04.png	cried out in exasperation. 'I've put everything I know
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-147/l04-147-05.png	before them....'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-00.png	'No dice, Hugh.' Roddy shook his sandy head.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-01.png	'They're bound to want pretty solid new evidence
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-02.png	before they'll agree to reopen the case. From
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-03.png	their point of view the evidence for suicide is
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-04.png	overwhelming. I spoke to a chap from the office of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-05.png	the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-06.png	well, and he agreed that the missing cash is
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-153/l04-153-07.png	a hell of a mystery.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-00.png	But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-01.png	money could have been disposed of in London
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-02.png	before your father left that evening. It wouldn't be
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-03.png	unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-04.png	for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-05.png	as particular debts of honour before taking his own
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-06.png	life. Also, logically, there's nothing to show the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-07.png	money couldn't have been pinched by someone
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-159/l04-159-08.png	passing the car after your father was dead.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-00.png	Stealing from cars is about the commonest
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-01.png	kind of crime in the book. There's nothing
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-02.png	that absolutely ties the missing money to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-03.png	circumstances of your father's death, that's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-04.png	the point. Same with the passport. It's gone
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-05.png	and that's that. It may turn up in a dustbin
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-06.png	somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-07.png	far as the police are concerned there's nothing
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-163/l04-163-08.png	to go on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-00.png	In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-01.png	happened, but that's not good enough for them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-02.png	That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-03.png	that your father took his life, backed by
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-04.png	medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-05.png	A little man with thin brown hair and a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-06.png	ruddy complexion came over and greeted
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-170/l04-170-07.png	them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-00.png	He wore a short white coat. Hugh ordered drinks.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-01.png	'I was sorry to read about your dad in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-02.png	paper', the man said to Hugh in a thick
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-03.png	voice which bore traces of a cockney accent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-04.png	'I was telling your friend how he come
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-174/l04-174-05.png	in here the very night he passed away.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-00.png	Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-01.png	man whom Roddy had raked up. He was seedy and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-02.png	middle-aged with small black eyes set close to-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-03.png	gether beneath heavily marked brows and a sly,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-04.png	crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-05.png	'He was hitting the bottle pretty hard, sir...' the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-06.png	man said in a loud whisper. 'Meaning no offe-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l04/l04-179/l04-179-07.png	nce', he added, looking at Hugh.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-00.png	&quot;You can't very well stop me.&quot; &quot;I can
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-01.png	do better than that. If we were to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-02.png	get married now I could come
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-03.png	with you.&quot; I looked down at my
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-04.png	plate, not daring to let him see
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-05.png	how much the idea appealed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-06.png	me, reminding myself that he could
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-07.png	only have said such a thing
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-08.png	because he did not know the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-080/l07-080-09.png	whole truth.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-00.png	&quot;And I can't allow that,&quot; I said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-01.png	&quot;Deadlock,&quot; said Max. &quot;No, it isn't.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-02.png	I'm determined to go, and by myself,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-03.png	whatever you say.&quot; &quot;I was afraid of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-04.png	that.&quot; He sounded resigned but none
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-05.png	the less hopeful. &quot;You're a very
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-06.png	wilful woman but I'll change
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-07.png	your mind for you one of these
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-085/l07-085-08.png	days.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-00.png	"You can see it any time you like,"
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-01.png	he told me. "The sooner the better.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-02.png	If you can get to Bletcham this
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-03.png	evening I'll run you up there
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-04.png	in the car." "That's very nice of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-05.png	you." "Nice, nothing. I told you,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-06.png	I'm mad about boats. Seven
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-103/l07-103-07.png	thirty do you?
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-00.png	I could meet you at the bus station.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-01.png	&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;outside your office.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-02.png	I could not endure the thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-03.png	of another wait at the bus station.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-04.png	He was there punctually. Dressed
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-05.png	in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-06.png	shorts he looked hardly more than
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-07.png	a boy, a cheerful, good-natured
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-08.png	boy. He settled me into the car
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-09.png	with touching care and then
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-10.png	drove like a fiend along
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-111/l07-111-11.png	the river road.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-00.png	He slapped himself in the face and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-01.png	cuffed the sides of his head. Then
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-02.png	by degrees the rotating objects
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-03.png	slowed, and coming into focus took
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-04.png	the form of the furnishings in Dan
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-05.png	Brown's living room. He stood up un-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-06.png	steadily and looked about the room,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-07.png	trying to gather his wits. Outside the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-08.png	dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-09.png	the heights beyond were in
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-012/m01-012-10.png	silhouette, already a solid black.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-00.png	He bumped into a floor lamp and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-01.png	switched it on. Heather McNabb still lay
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-02.png	on the couch, her body uncomfortably twisted
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-03.png	and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-04.png	He went to the kitchen for water and found
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-05.png	Dan. Dan was lying on a long bench in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-06.png	breakfast nook, his head bent upright
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-017/m01-017-07.png	against the wall.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-00.png	His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-01.png	as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-02.png	brought forward. He mouthed a low mutter, punctuated at intervals
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-03.png	with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon. As
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-04.png	Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-022/m01-022-05.png	with jaws askew.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-00.png	There was utter imbecility in his blank face. Presently the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-01.png	muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-02.png	shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-03.png	Heather. Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-04.png	trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-05.png	For several minutes they had been facing each other across
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-06.png	a low table, like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-026/m01-026-07.png	each other through forced association.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-00.png	And these had been his great qualities,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-01.png	so attractive to her. The Base Station had
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-02.png	gone before, discharging its narrow plane of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-03.png	4ementalating energy along the length of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-04.png	the Earth's imaginary longitudes, moving
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-05.png	eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-06.png	reversed progression. It had brought the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-07.png	First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-08.png	the empty-minded receptiveness that
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-038/m01-038-09.png	prepared the way for the Second Stage.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-00.png	&quot;They have come!&quot; he said reverently, gripping his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-01.png	hands together between his knees and leaning
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-02.png	forward. &quot;Isn't it a glorious thing! Long awaited
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-03.png	transcendent event, the exalted desire of all
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-04.png	mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-05.png	Mind is at hand!&quot; He turned beaming eyes
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-06.png	upward and shook his head slowly from
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-060/m01-060-07.png	side to side.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-00.png	A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-01.png	abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-02.png	at an intersection for the light to change. At his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-03.png	apartment he garaged his car and then stood
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-04.png	listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-05.png	earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-079/m01-079-06.png	loses its beat in death.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-00.png	Deadly stillness, deadly portent!
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-01.png	Steve awakened early and switched on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-02.png	the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-03.png	The set lighted-up but gave only a low
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-04.png	buzzing sound. He had just finished
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-05.png	shaving when it came on, with a flat
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-06.png	voice repeating: &quot;This is BBC calling
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-084/m01-084-07.png	. . . this is BBC calling. . .&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-00.png	Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-01.png	Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-02.png	flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-03.png	the War Memorial. There was a deep
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-04.png	whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-05.png	overtone that sang in his ears with an
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-06.png	almost painful sharpness. He reversed and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-095/m01-095-07.png	turned back on McKenzie Avenue.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-00.png	&quot;The Thetans,&quot; he said, &quot;are presumably here to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-01.png	take charge, as it were, of the minds of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-02.png	people - who are probably falling all over them-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-03.png	selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-04.png	them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-05.png	know. Now, because of prior hypnosis we have es-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-06.png	caped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we no
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-104/m01-104-07.png	longer have any immunity.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-00.png	There is just a hope that we may uncover
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-01.png	some weakness, and find a way of fighting
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-02.png	back at them.&quot; Heather agreed, and suggested
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-03.png	that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-04.png	ting how the Thetan machinations had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-05.png	working out. It occurred to Steve that this may
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-06.png	not have been entirely an objective suggestion
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-07.png	on her part; but he thought it a good idea
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-121/m01-121-08.png	nevertheless.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-00.png	There can be little doubt that if the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-01.png	Thetans discover our mental independence
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-02.png	they will promptly give us their hypnotic
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-03.png	treatment. If we can avoid undue
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-04.png	prominence, it may be that we can
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-05.png	move about pretty freely without
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-06.png	detection. If we can - well, then we
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-07.png	may be able to promote our own
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-08.png	interests. What those interests
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-09.png	are, beyond personal security,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-10.png	I haven't a clue; but, who knows,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-110/m01-110-11.png	we may form the nucleus around ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-00.png	When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-01.png	gave the impression of having been thought out and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-02.png	decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-03.png	Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-04.png	of their presence. They just stared at him, turning
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-05.png	their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-131/m01-131-06.png	down, up and down.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-00.png	&quot;Now, to summarize what I think our
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-01.png	course of action should be. First, to avoid the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-02.png	Thetans like the plague, for they must not
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-03.png	find us out! Second, to tread pretty warily
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-04.png	among our own people, finding out just how
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-05.png	much freedom we can take with safety.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-06.png	And third, to study these damned Thetans.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-07.png	We must learn all we can about
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-115/m01-115-08.png	them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-00.png	So they proceeded to see if the coast
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-01.png	was clear. The street was quiet and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-02.png	deserted, and there were neither sight
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-03.png	nor sound of flying saucers. So they
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-04.png	ventured forth and made their way on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-05.png	foot to Dan's house. Dan came
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-06.png	to the door at their ring but neglected
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-07.png	to offer any greeting. He was deeply
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-08.png	preoccupied, and it seemed that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-09.png	ringing of a doorbell was to him
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-125/m01-125-10.png	a new and strange phenomenon.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-00.png	His whole attitude was a mixture of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-01.png	impatience pending an awaited
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-02.png	communication and of a vague
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-03.png	perplexity respecting his surroundings
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-04.png	and the purpose he was to serve.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-05.png	Finally, being so obviously on their own,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-06.png	Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-07.png	at home. Steve switched on Dan's
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-08.png	powerful, world-wide radio and systematically
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-09.png	turned the tuning knob through all the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-136/m01-136-10.png	tuning points of the world's great radio
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-00.png	They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-01.png	he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-02.png	But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-03.png	the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-04.png	been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-05.png	First, it was Sunday morning; and, second, everyone
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-06.png	walked, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-149/m01-149-07.png	a single all-exclusive purpose.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-00.png	Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-01.png	real days and would return to New York in late
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-02.png	January or early February. Angelina might be a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-03.png	little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-04.png	as arranged, but he consoled himself by
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-05.png	thinking that he and Angelina would have
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-06.png	plenty of time together in the future. And
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-07.png	Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-08.png	back on Moon again, and able to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-09.png	research at first hand into matters on which
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-048/m02-048-10.png	the future of everyone, including Angelina, depended...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-00.png	The recovery of his balance was due to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-01.png	fact that he was living, virtually without
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-02.png	expenses, with the people to whom Moke had
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-03.png	sent him: little people who regarded him as
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-04.png	lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-05.png	Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-052/m02-052-06.png	(Stamp Department) while Sally sulked at home.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-00.png	They had been married for six years, but the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-01.png	salary raise, on the expectation of which they
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-02.png	had done so, had not materialised. &quot;Do you
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-03.png	know, I had to send back our bedroom
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-04.png	furniture in the second year,&quot; she moaned. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-05.png	had contacts in political circles, a school-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-06.png	friend of hers having married Lester Peron,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-07.png	a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-08.png	(literally) all-powerful Rocket Release
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-09.png	Board.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-055/m02-055-10.png	Hostettler
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-00.png	Sometimes she took Harry around with her, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-01.png	never her husband, a fact he accepted as inevitable. &quot;I guess
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-02.png	Sally made a mistake about me,&quot; he said one
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-03.png	evening, when he had been left to cook his own meal.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-04.png	All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now, but Tom
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-05.png	was a Static Mib, the middle-income-bracket equivalent
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-059/m02-059-06.png	to 4sub-lil on the lower.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-00.png	All Aristotle was excited at the time, not by the prospect of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-01.png	U.S. President's visit, but by a great storm in the photo-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-02.png	sphere of the sun. A matter which on Earth would hardly
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-03.png	penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-04.png	interest to the Mos, doubtless because their habitat is
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-066/m02-066-05.png	not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-00.png	One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-01.png	with time instil the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-02.png	especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-03.png	Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-04.png	solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-05.png	used in the last few wars, but it seemed very probable
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-06.png	that they would be in the next one, Moon and her
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-07.png	allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-069/m02-069-08.png	weapons pronounced conventional.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-00.png	Lester was not home yet from his formidable
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-01.png	duties and his wife, in the manner of middle-brow
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-02.png	wives, romanced about him in his absence. &quot;Lester was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-03.png	country lawyer, and we were very small 4microdebs, weren't we,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-04.png	Sally&quot; - here she had dropped her voice in homage to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-05.png	economic system: that was reverenced - &quot;when he thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-072/m02-072-06.png	we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-00.png	Know how he did it? He's clever on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-01.png	the mouth-organ. So when he visited some
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-02.png	craterlet on Face (ours is an agricultural
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-03.png	Back-Face area) the cry would go up,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-04.png	as soon as he had spoken a few
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-05.png	sentences of his speech: 'Cut the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-06.png	politics, Lester, give us something on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-075/m02-075-07.png	your mouth-organ.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-00.png	But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-01.png	or B in the finals next May, and since mating
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-02.png	prospects would depend upon salaries, scholarship for
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-03.png	these fine young people was closely geared to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-04.png	economic and biological ends which, essentially,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-05.png	were really means. So, seeing them revolve in
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-06.png	circles, Harry had the feeling that Moke (or what
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-07.png	Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised, any-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-08.png	way in Harry's mind) had these splendid young
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-106/m02-106-09.png	people by the short hairs, and was diverting them ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-00.png	Sentence Database
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-01.png	That's how he got the votes, that's how
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-02.png	we came through to 4makrodeb status and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-03.png	got all these lovely things" - she waved a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-04.png	plump hand towards her grand pianos, etc:
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-05.png	at the same time a door banged - "but don't
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-06.png	say a word about it, Lester wants his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-07.png	mouth-organ to be forgotten now. The time
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-08.png	has come for him to be taken seriously
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-080/m02-080-09.png	as a statesman."
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-00.png	But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-01.png	Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer, to have the same adolescent
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-02.png	openness and freshness, though perhaps not the same
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-03.png	maturity. One remembered that he was a lawyer
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-04.png	by training, and suspected that the points he made
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-05.png	so sharply in international politics were as abstract
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-06.png	to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-087/m02-087-07.png	of law.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-00.png	The motive would be the same in both cases, to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-01.png	serve this home of his, in which his heart lay.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-02.png	Here the rocket man's charm was disarming. Yet
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-03.png	when the time came to leave, Harry felt as de-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-04.png	pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-05.png	exactly a month ago. If even Mo statesmen only
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-06.png	did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-07.png	ding scale, and left the sum-total of their actions,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-08.png	and their lunar and earthly repercussions, to luck
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-09.png	(or to Moke), there was a vacuum where there should
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-090/m02-090-10.png	be a centre of trust, responsible for the maintenance
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-00.png	The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-01.png	like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-02.png	guise which, far from attracting the allegiance
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-03.png	of free men everywhere, could only repel them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-04.png	Then what of the cultural life? Did this per-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-05.png	haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-06.png	which might in time become social fact
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-07.png	and counteract the obsession with economics
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-08.png	which had grown up during the Moon's
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-095/m02-095-09.png	first two centuries?
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-00.png	At the centre of each circle stood personnel
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-01.png	managers of corporations, together with professors
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-02.png	and their filing clerks. The students had
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-03.png	bought their college education forward and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-04.png	were now being bought forward in their
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-05.png	turn. By comparing personal appearances
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-06.png	with university records, the agents of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-07.png	businesses would pick on young men
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-08.png	and women who interested them, and contracts
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-09.png	would be initialled at the end of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-102/m02-102-10.png	the parade.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-00.png	Stepping out in their white shorts, they looked glad enough
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-01.png	to be diverted, however, with the single exception of one
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-02.png	worried little man-student who kept getting out of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-03.png	step. He looked as if nothing Moke and his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-04.png	minions could do to him would ever make him
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-05.png	GO; but the reason probably lay in elementary
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-06.png	neurosis and not in some eruption from those
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-07.png	deeper layers in the human psyche which are
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-109/m02-109-08.png	trans-economic.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-00.png	So once again the metaphysics were depressing,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-01.png	and in absolute contrast to the physical display.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-02.png	Mos have an un-American love of parades, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-03.png	these young ones, on parade for jobs which they
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-04.png	had to get to pay off their college bills, were naturally
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-112/m02-112-05.png	putting their best foot forward.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-00.png	'Something's up,' said Lord Undertone,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-01.png	carefully casual. 'The servants are all on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-02.png	edge... did you notice? And the mules
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-03.png	didn't seem to want to get off the raft.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-04.png	He peered as it were into the dark secrets
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-05.png	of the jungle. 'Think there's Indians
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-06.png	about?' It was most certainly an eerie
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-07.png	night, exceptionally brilliant and strange,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-08.png	for in the proximity of the mountains,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-006/m03-006-09.png	whose presence I could almost smell,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-00.png	'Impressive,' Lord Undertone said, gazing reverently
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-01.png	on the cosmic handiwork. 'All those stars. But I'm
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-02.png	a bit earthbound tonight, Trout. I've got a queer
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-03.png	feeling, like I always get when something
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-04.png	sensational's going to happen. There's things lurking
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-05.png	if you ask me. Might be jaguar, might be...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-013/m03-013-06.png	head-shrinkers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-00.png	Hope I die kind of composed, Trout. I mean you can't
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-01.png	imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-02.png	no matter how bad it felt, the fire you know, or a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-03.png	lion munching, or arrows where it hurts most. Or
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-04.png	can you. Look over there.' He pointed to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-020/m03-020-05.png	shadows beyond the river. 'Something moved.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-00.png	'Bottle-Foot, my lord.' 'Bottle-Foot?' His lordship
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-01.png	may have thought I had become unbalanced
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-02.png	through fear. 'A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-03.png	to other day, my lord. A being of whom
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-04.png	the forest Indians are said to be mortally
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-05.png	afraid, with a hoof shaped like the heel
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-06.png	of a bottle. If your lordship will excuse me
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-033/m03-033-07.png	a moment...'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-00.png	Small, repulsive creatures they were,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-01.png	with black, matted hair and a striking
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-02.png	resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-03.png	gazed at recently; and I have no
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-04.png	hesitation in saying that they would have
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-05.png	made an end of us but for an intervention
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-06.png	so unexpected, so unusual, that only the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-07.png	necessity of rounding my narrative
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-062/m03-062-08.png	compels me to mention it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-00.png	I had a distinct impression that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-01.png	hut had recently been cleaned and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-02.png	prepared for visitors. Mrs Caine said
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-03.png	we were to go no further unless and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-04.png	until we were sent for, confirming
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-05.png	another impression that became more
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-06.png	and more definite, namely, that
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-07.png	she was in touch with an invi-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-095/m03-095-08.png	sible source of authority.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-00.png	NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-01.png	single-decker Welsh bus could have got
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-02.png	itself into orbit. Shooting up over the pass a bit
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-03.png	too carefree, and becoming airborne?
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-04.png	Caught by a sudden gust of wind? A
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-05.png	combination of the two? No one seems
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-06.png	to know. But the fact remains that get
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-000/m04-000-07.png	itself into orbit it did.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-00.png	And a fine old fuss there was about it, too.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-01.png	Here are the known facts. On 10th July,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-02.png	the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-03.png	left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-04.png	Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-05.png	Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-06.png	pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-07.png	and Miss Ethel Yates, hikers from
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-08.png	Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-007/m04-007-09.png	Rev. Edwards.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-00.png	Yes, the bus set out from Dinas. So much
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-01.png	is established. Ifor Huw Evans, Propr.,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-02.png	watched it go from the windows of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-03.png	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-04.png	Ifor was. For there was his garage hand,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-05.png	Dai Pugh, taking a tearful farewell of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-06.png	Morfydd Owen. Morfydd, who had until
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-07.png	recently been Ifor's typist, but was now
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-08.png	returning to her home town as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-012/m04-012-09.png	fully-fledged schoolteacher.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-00.png	&quot;But I'm only going fifteen miles away,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-01.png	Morfydd was saying. &quot;Not the end of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-02.png	the world, is it?&quot; &quot;For me it is,&quot; Dai
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-03.png	said wretchedly, wiping his hands on his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-04.png	overalls preparatory to a last embrace. &quot;You
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-05.png	will not be remembering a mere garage
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-06.png	hand when you are lording it over
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-019/m04-019-07.png	the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-00.png	&quot;Silly boy,&quot; said Morfydd. Though she
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-01.png	could not help wondering whether, now she
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-02.png	had qualified as a schoolteacher, poor
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-03.png	little Dai was quite the man for her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-04.png	A nice boy of course. But perhaps in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-05.png	new world she was entering there might
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-06.png	be boys equally nice, and with far more
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-024/m04-024-07.png	to offer. The conductor rang his bell.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-00.png	"Good-bye, Dai," said Morfydd, smiling from the bottom step.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-01.png	"Good-bye, Morfydd." He sought to enfold her in his arms. But he was too late.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-02.png	She was already up the bus steps, and the bus was away. And Morfydd Owen
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-03.png	waving, unkissed, from the window. And Dai, on the pavement, knowing in his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-030/m04-030-04.png	heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-00.png	So the bus set out for Llangrwl. But it never reached there! Somewhere,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-01.png	on those fifteen miles of mountain roads, it disappeared from the earthly
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-02.png	scene. The first intimation that all was not well came when a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-03.png	Mr. Isaiah Roberts, landlord of The Traveller's Joy, rang up the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-04.png	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-038/m04-038-05.png	damn bus.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-00.png	"Left here all right," said Ifor. "Two-thirty-five, on the dot." "It's
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-01.png	supposed to leave at two-twenty." "Who says so?" "Your timetable."
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-02.png	"Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables," Ifor said,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-03.png	reasonably. "Start running punctual and where are you? People get
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-043/m04-043-04.png	left behind, isn't it? Very exasperating for one and all."
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-00.png	&quot;And what are you going to do about it?&quot; Tendentious, Mr. Roberts sounded.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-01.png	&quot;What do you want me to do? Send out a sheriff's posse, is it?&quot; No sense
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-02.png	of humour, that Isaiah. He banged down the receiver. Very uncivil. Dropped
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-03.png	the mask, now, Ifor did. &quot;Dai Pugh,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;Leap on your bicycle
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-061/m04-061-04.png	and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-00.png	The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-01.png	complete her mission.&quot; Paled, did Dai. For the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-02.png	two-twenty carried, for him, a cargo more
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-03.png	precious than jewels. Though Mofydd Owen
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-04.png	was, as he feared, departed out of his life,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-05.png	he still loved her dearly. Already, even
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-06.png	as with trembling fingers he fastened his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-07.png	trouser clips, he was seeing her lying in
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-08.png	some dreadful ravine, or beset by
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-09.png	robbers, or being whisked off to Emergency
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-072/m04-072-10.png	Ward 10.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-00.png	But even his imagination, luckily for him,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-01.png	did not visualise the awful truth - that
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-02.png	Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-03.png	the title of &quot;First Woman to Enter Space.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-04.png	&quot;Where are we going, Mam?&quot; inquired little
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-05.png	Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-06.png	the fact that the green earth was falling
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-078/m04-078-07.png	away at a rate of knots.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-00.png	Where indeed? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-01.png	to the conductor, demanding an explanation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-02.png	But nonplussed, the conductor was. A
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-03.png	good man, mind; knew his job. But out of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-04.png	depth in this particular instance. Fingered
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-05.png	his ticket-punch nervously. Peered out of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-06.png	the window. Went and consulted the driver.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-07.png	"Where are we going?" he echoed Cadwallader.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-08.png	"Damned if I know, boy," said the driver.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-09.png	"But something very untoward has
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-081/m04-081-10.png	happened, if you ask me."
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-00.png	Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser, was the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-01.png	Rev. Edwards. Now he put down his paper,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-02.png	folded it, and glanced idly out of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-03.png	window. Looked again, eyes starting from
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-04.png	his head. &quot;God bless my immortal soul,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-05.png	he cried. &quot;Never mind your immortal
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-06.png	soul,&quot; said Megan Thomas tartly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-07.png	&quot;Here we are traversing the heavens at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-08.png	very moment when we should be
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-093/m04-093-09.png	running into Llangrwl bus station.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-00.png	And no one doing the first thing about
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-01.png	it.&quot; Stung, the conductor was. &quot;What you
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-02.png	expect me to do?&quot; he inquired, bitter.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-03.png	&quot;Radio Flying Control at London Airport,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-04.png	is it?&quot; &quot;Mutual recriminations will get
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-05.png	us nowhere,&quot; boomed the Rev. Edwards.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-06.png	&quot;It's all very well,&quot; commented
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-100/m04-100-07.png	Mr. Hayball from the back seat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-00.png	&quot;But Eth and me wanted to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-01.png	at the Youth Hostel before dark.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-02.png	Morfydd Owen was silent. But she
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-03.png	looked down at the fast-disappearing
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-04.png	earth, and it seemed to her that she
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-05.png	would never see her Dai again. And
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-06.png	though half an hour ago she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-07.png	regarded this possibility with
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-08.png	fortitude, it now filled her with
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-09.png	dismay. Quietly she began to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-107/m04-107-10.png	weep...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-00.png	Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-01.png	furiously on the road. Not a sign of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-02.png	the bus. He passed The Traveller's
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-03.png	Joy. At last he caught up Mr. Roberts,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-04.png	walking very dogged towards Llangrwl.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-05.png	&quot;Afternoon, Mr. Roberts,&quot; he called, polite,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-06.png	as he shot past. His spirits were rising.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-07.png	He had seen no sign of an accident.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-08.png	Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-09.png	He would find the bus safe and sound in
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-113/m04-113-10.png	Llangrwl, and his dear Morfydd quietly
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-00.png	But disappointment awaited him. A
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-01.png	restive queue of people in the bus station,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-02.png	waiting to be transported to Dinas. And
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-03.png	when he went to Morfydd's house, all
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-04.png	he found was Morfydd's mam, working
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-05.png	herself up proper... Getting dark, now.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-06.png	The conductor switched on the lights.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-07.png	The beleaguered passengers peered out of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-08.png	the windows. Little to be seen, only a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-09.png	few lone stars, and the distant earth
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-123/m04-123-10.png	brooding in her shroud of mist.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-00.png	Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped, nursing
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-01.png	the sleeping Cadwallader. Driver and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-02.png	conductor peered ahead into nothingness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-03.png	On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-04.png	his Eth. Morfydd thought of Dai. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-05.png	Rev. Edwards, standing at the front,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-06.png	looked at his forlorn flock. "What
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-07.png	about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda?"
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-131/m04-131-08.png	he suggested hopefully.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-00.png	They looked at him, sullen. His heart
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-01.png	sank. If the Welsh found the situation
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-02.png	too desperate for singing, then the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-03.png	situation, he realised, must be desperate
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-04.png	indeed. But suddenly they were roused
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-05.png	from their lethargy. Something was
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-06.png	approaching, faster, faster, a tearing
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-07.png	hurrying blur that was past and gone
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-08.png	in a moment, followed by a great
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-138/m04-138-09.png	rush of sound. They waved frantically.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-00.png	He saluted, and left the presence, very crestfallen...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-01.png	Time passed. The bus climbed, and went quietly
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-02.png	into orbit. Time passed. The Rev. Edwards' pulpit
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-03.png	remained empty. And so did the arms of Dai
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-04.png	Pugh. How could they be otherwise, when his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-05.png	beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-06.png	quarter-hour intervals, regular as clockwork?
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-07.png	Time passed. Everyone said, &quot;Pity about Megan
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-08.png	Thomas, isn't it,&quot; as though they didn't really think
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-190/m04-190-09.png	it was a pity at all; as, indeed, they didn't.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-00.png	LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-01.png	Dinas Advertiser. But the London papers ignored
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-02.png	the whole affair. Ifor Evans reported his loss
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-03.png	to the police. But they only tut-tutted. &quot;Lost
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-04.png	a bus, is it. Very careless.&quot; That was their
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-05.png	attitude. Now if there'd been a good old accident,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-06.png	they could have measured up the road and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-200/m04-200-07.png	taken an interest.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-00.png	But losing a bus! People were always losing
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-01.png	things. You'd be surprised, they said. So it
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-02.png	seemed, for a time, that the whole affair would
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-03.png	be written off as one of those unexplained
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-04.png	mysteries, like the Marie Celeste. Then things
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-05.png	began to happen... But what about the voyagers?
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-209/m04-209-06.png	you will be asking.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-00.png	Well, the Rev. Edwards had taken command. "Our
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-01.png	position," he said, "is somewhat analogous to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-02.png	that of a castaway on a desert island. Now
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-03.png	what does such a person do? He signals
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-04.png	his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-05.png	flag on a palm tree. And he tries to ensure
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-216/m04-216-06.png	a supply of food."
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-00.png	&quot;Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-01.png	the conductor said firmly. &quot;Contrary to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-02.png	Company's Regulations.&quot; &quot;Of course not,&quot; agreed
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-03.png	the minister. &quot;No, we have another way of signalling
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-04.png	our position. The driver must sound his horn
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-05.png	continuously.&quot; Gave him a look, the driver did.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-06.png	&quot;Where you think we are?&quot; he asked rudely.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-222/m04-222-07.png	&quot;Dinas High Street?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-00.png	&quot;Do as I say, driver.&quot; Very stern, the reverend
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-01.png	gentleman was. So the driver peep-peeped as
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-02.png	through empty space. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the Rev.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-03.png	Edwards said courteously. &quot;Secondly, we must
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-04.png	pool and ration our supplies of food, if any.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-05.png	He looked at Price the Provisions, who was nursing
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-231/m04-231-06.png	a great basket.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-00.png	&quot;Now, who has any food?&quot; he asked hopefully.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-01.png	Stared back did Price the Provisions, unwinking.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-02.png	&quot;Mr. Price, I think you may be able to help us here,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-03.png	said the Rev. Edwards. Price shook his head.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-04.png	&quot;Intended for Plas Newydd, this lot is. Paid for,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-238/m04-238-05.png	too.&quot; He folded his arms protectively over the basket.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-00.png	Mutinous dog, thought the Rev. Edwards, who hadn't
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-01.png	enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-02.png	Island. &quot;What have you got in that basket, Price?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-03.png	he roared. Quelled, Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-04.png	list, pushed his glasses up on his nose, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-05.png	began to read. &quot;Six loaves, four pounds butter,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-246/m04-246-06.png	two pounds marge, one tin pineapple, one York ham.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-00.png	Bertram's face was grim. &quot;You think it was the Snort,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-01.png	don't you?&quot; John gave a short laugh. &quot;I did,&quot; he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-02.png	said; &quot;but I'd better stop thinking that now.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-03.png	Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-04.png	&quot;So there you are, my dear.&quot; Peggy's eyes filled
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-000/n04-000-05.png	with tears. &quot;It's so unfair,&quot; she said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-00.png	&quot;That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-01.png	months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-02.png	dockyard and now that she's ready for sea he goes
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-03.png	sick. Just because he's an Honourable he can do
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-04.png	what he likes. Anyway, why pick on you to succeed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-05.png	him?&quot; John didn't answer. There was no point
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-009/n04-009-06.png	in sharing his discomfort with Peggy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-00.png	'But we -' 'Stop your stupid talk, woman!' 'We are -'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-01.png	'Be silent, woman, and listen,' Band Appa Bondi said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-02.png	'We know much,' repeated the Chief Captive. 'Some
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-03.png	things we will tell you. All who make the journey from
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-04.png	the Heavy World become changed. Some die. Most live
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-05.png	and grow wings. Between the worlds are many strong
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-031/m06-031-06.png	rays, not seen or felt, which change our bodies.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-00.png	When you come here, when you come to the True
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-01.png	World, you become a true human. The grub of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-02.png	tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So humans
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-03.png	change.' 'I cannot know what he says,' Haris said
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-04.png	stubbornly, throwing himself down. But Lily-yo and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-042/m06-042-05.png	Flor were listening.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-00.png	'To this True World, as you call it, we come to die,'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-01.png	Lily-yo said, doubtingly. The Captive with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-02.png	fleshless jaw said, 'The grub of the tigerfly thinks
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-03.png	it dies when it changes into a tigerfly.' 'You are still
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-04.png	young,' said the Chief Captive. 'You begin newly here.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-05.png	Where are your souls?' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-06.png	each other. In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-048/m06-048-07.png	heedlessly thrown down their souls.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-00.png	Haris had trampled on his. It was unthinkable!
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-01.png	'You see. You needed them no more. You are still
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-02.png	young. You may be able to have babies. Some of those
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-03.png	babies may be born with wings.' The Captive with
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-04.png	the boneless arms added, 'Some may be born wrong,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-056/m06-056-05.png	as we are. Some may be born right.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-00.png	'You are too foul to live!' Haris growled. 'Why are
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-01.png	you not killed?' 'Because we know all things,' the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-02.png	Chief Captive said. Suddenly his second head roused
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-03.png	itself and declared, 'To be a good shape is not all
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-04.png	in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot move
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-05.png	well we can - think. This tribe of the True World
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-067/m06-067-06.png	is good and knows these things.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-00.png	So it lets us rule it.' Flor and Lily-yo
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-01.png	muttered together. 'Do you say that you poor
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-02.png	Captives rule the True World?' Lily-yo asked
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-03.png	at last. 'We do.' 'Then why are you captives?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-04.png	The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-05.png	making his perpetual little gesture of protest,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-076/m06-076-06.png	spoke for the first time.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-00.png	'To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-01.png	are slaves to it. Only an outcast is free. Because
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-02.png	we are Captives, we have the time to talk and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-03.png	think and plan and know. Those who know
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-04.png	command the knives of others.' 'No hurt will
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-05.png	come to you, Lily-yo,' Band Appa Bondi added.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-06.png	'You will live among us and enjoy your life free
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-083/m06-083-07.png	from harm.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-00.png	'No!' the Chief Captive said with both mouths.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-01.png	'Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-02.png	Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-03.png	must help our great plan.' 'The invasion?' Bondi
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-04.png	asked. 'What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-05.png	here at a good time. Memories of the Heavy World
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-091/m06-091-06.png	and its savage life are still fresh in you.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-00.png	We need such memories. So we ask you to go
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-01.png	back there on a great plan we have.' 'Go back?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-02.png	gasped Flor. 'Yes. We plan to attack the Heavy
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-03.png	World. You must help to lead our force.' The long
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-04.png	afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-05.png	of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-098/m06-098-06.png	everlasting night.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-00.png	Motion there was, but motion without event - except
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-01.png	for those negligible events that seemed so large to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-02.png	the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-03.png	and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-04.png	that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-05.png	with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-06.png	new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-07.png	light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-08.png	flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-106/m06-106-09.png	had no place here.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-00.png	Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-01.png	been inclined to regard women as something
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-02.png	which must necessarily be subordinated to his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-03.png	career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-04.png	his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-05.png	whom he had never met and on whom after no more
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-06.png	than a couple of telephone calls he was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-000/n01-000-07.png	prepared to place complete reliance.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-00.png	&quot;Good luck, Air Marshal,&quot; she said gently. &quot;I'll
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-01.png	be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-02.png	evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-03.png	both at midnight.&quot; They might have been
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-04.png	arranging a supper party. Then she rang off.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-05.png	Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-06.png	uneventful life had he come across a girl who
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-07.png	sounded so charming and appeared to be so
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-009/n01-009-08.png	efficient.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-00.png	It was a novel experience. Alastair was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-01.png	quite unable to explain why he should feel
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-02.png	so much confidence in her. Once again
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-03.png	she checked back her instructions. It was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-04.png	obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-05.png	faith which he was placing in her and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-004/n01-004-06.png	was prepared to accept the responsibility.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-00.png	For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-01.png	to switch on the lights; there was no colour -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-02.png	physical features were distinguishable solely by
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-03.png	gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-04.png	capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-05.png	below, was not recognisable among the host
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-06.png	of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-07.png	radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-08.png	flickered across its surface, but there was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-020/n01-020-09.png	no permanent image.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-00.png	In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-01.png	make a direct comparison between the radar
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-02.png	image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-03.png	Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-04.png	left, Milan. The directional angle of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-05.png	scanner could be adjusted to cover any
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-06.png	particular area within its range. Geoffrey
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-07.png	turned the scale slowly to cover the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-031/n01-031-08.png	ground immediately ahead.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-00.png	Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-01.png	pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-02.png	dipped slightly. The needle of the speed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-03.png	recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-04.png	before coming to rest at 5.0. "We're a bit
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-05.png	ahead of time," said Alastair. "We'll run
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-06.png	in on minimum engine power." Geoffrey
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-07.png	smiled. Alastair talked of running in when
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-08.png	they were still more than four hundred
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-045/n01-045-09.png	miles from their destination.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-00.png	Geoffrey set himself to consider the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-01.png	movements of the Bentley. It had passed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-02.png	him at the temporary bridge over the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-03.png	Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-04.png	previous night. He worked out the distance
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-05.png	on the presumption that its route had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-06.png	through Florence and Rome and then
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-07.png	across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-08.png	It came to just over six hundred
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-057/n01-057-09.png	miles.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-00.png	DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-01.png	time they docked at Belleray. And though Guy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-02.png	made nervous by Beryl's silence, drove at reckless
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-03.png	speed to the Villa, it was quickly evident that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-04.png	the party was over. Piers came strolling out to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-05.png	meet the Deanes, and as soon as Guy had
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-06.png	driven away, invited them casually to come to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-000/n02-000-07.png	his flat for a drink.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-00.png	&quot;Oh, she was due!&quot; And then he added in the same
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-01.png	casual tone, &quot;She's not returning to her family. She's
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-02.png	going to live with friends of the bank manager, just
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-03.png	this side of Belleray.&quot; Mrs. Deane made a suitable
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-04.png	comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-05.png	to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-06.png	unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-016/n02-016-07.png	with anger against her she had no doubt.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-00.png	To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-01.png	vengeance. She had expected to be met with violent
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-02.png	reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-03.png	But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-04.png	was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-05.png	He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-06.png	own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-07.png	asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-004/n02-004-08.png	to come over and make the presentation in her stead.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-00.png	&quot;I caught him just as he was going to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-01.png	airport to meet Blanche,&quot; he said. &quot;As a matter
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-02.png	of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-03.png	for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-04.png	too. They're both here.&quot; &quot;I didn't know she was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-05.png	coming back from Barbados so soon.&quot; Beryl
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-009/n02-009-06.png	said the first thing that came into her head.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-00.png	Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-01.png	express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-02.png	of his guests. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-03.png	suggested having a second party, the following week, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-04.png	poured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-05.png	had had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-06.png	nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-07.png	Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-08.png	earned gratuity to his native village at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-028/n02-028-09.png	north of the island.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-00.png	"It's your superior attitude that riles me." Beryl was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-01.png	scarlet with annoyance. "How I happened to be marooned
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-02.png	at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree. You
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-03.png	look as though it was only what you expected of me,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-04.png	as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-049/n02-049-05.png	and his pals down."
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-00.png	It was all over and done with.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-01.png	For the time being Beryl was content to let
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-02.png	it go at that, but she resolved to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-03.png	it out with Piers when a reasonable
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-04.png	opportunity presented itself. He must
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-05.png	learn that he could not treat her
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-06.png	with injustice and contempt, ignoring
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-07.png	her explanations as though he were
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-08.png	a schoolmaster and she a small,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-033/n02-033-09.png	ignorant child.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-00.png	He gave her no chance of any private
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-01.png	conversation that evening, for when
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-02.png	Blanche and Jack left, he went with
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-03.png	them. But next morning she insisted
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-04.png	on his taking her out in the jeep -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-05.png	to find, if possible, Hubert and his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-06.png	relations, and tell them of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-07.png	her great disappointment at being
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-037/n02-037-08.png	held up in Balicou.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-00.png	With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-01.png	Boxer, to the back, and made room for her
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-02.png	beside him. &quot;Is that all you want to do?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-03.png	he asked, letting in the clutch. &quot;No; I want
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-04.png	to make you understand just what happened
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-05.png	about this Balicou trip,&quot; she returned
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-06.png	coldly. &quot;I'm a little tired of being treated
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-040/n02-040-07.png	like an ineffective imbecile.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-00.png	&quot;And I'm heartily sick of being constantly called
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-01.png	to account for my manners,&quot; he retorted.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-02.png	&quot;What have I done wrong now? I cover up for
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-03.png	you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-04.png	to make the presentation, I run the damned
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-05.png	party to the best of my ability - saying the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-06.png	sugary things you ought to have been there
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-07.png	to say - and all you can do is to find
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-045/n02-045-08.png	fault.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-00.png	&quot;As your employee it's not my business
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-01.png	to understand all the whys and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-02.png	wherefores of your actions,&quot; he said
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-03.png	stiffly. &quot;Still less to criticise you.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-04.png	&quot;Oh, drop that nonsense, Piers!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-05.png	Be yourself,&quot; she exclaimed, with
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-06.png	mounting exasperation. &quot;Very well!&quot; He
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-07.png	brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-08.png	path fringed and shaded by citrus trees.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-054/n02-054-09.png	&quot;If you want my true opinion I'll give it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-00.png	You made some sort of a protest to Graybury.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-01.png	I'll give you credit for that. But you didn't press
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-02.png	the matter because, very naturally, you were
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-03.png	thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-04.png	idyllic surroundings.&quot; &quot;How dare you say
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-05.png	such a thing?&quot; she blazed. &quot;For goodness'
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-06.png	sake show a glimmer of reason,&quot; was his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-062/n02-062-07.png	equally indignant rejoinder.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-00.png	&quot;You talk as though we were alone on Balicou!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-01.png	She avoided his gaze, and tried to ignore that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-02.png	last impertinent remark. &quot;With four other people -&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-03.png	&quot;Whom you never once managed to circumvent.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-04.png	The mockery in his voice had deepened. &quot;With
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-05.png	all due deference, Miss Deane - come off it!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-06.png	She met his eyes then.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-00.png	She wavered, and at last said
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-01.png	slowly, &quot;If you must drag the truth
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-02.png	out of me, I must ask you to regard
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-03.png	it as confidential.&quot; &quot;My dear Beryl,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-04.png	don't tell me anything, if you'd rather
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-05.png	not.&quot; He was clearly startled by her
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-06.png	words. &quot;But remember, it was you,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-098/n02-098-07.png	not I, who started this conversation.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-00.png	&quot;Neither can Nigel,&quot; smiled Diana.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-01.png	&quot;He's saving up to get married. Remember?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-02.png	&quot;I remember,&quot; quipped the houseman,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-03.png	meaning no offence, &quot;but does he?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-04.png	That blonde was something.&quot; &quot;Anybody
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-05.png	I know?&quot; she smiled. &quot;I think so.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-06.png	I got a good look at her. But if Nigel
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-07.png	wasn't there it isn't important, is it?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-08.png	&quot;No,&quot; Di said immediately. &quot;It isn't at
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-057/p03-057-09.png	all important.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-00.png	&quot;Oh, he wasn't. His motor-bike had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-01.png	broken down outside and he noticed
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-02.png	your car and then you dancing with
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-03.png	this blonde.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; Nigel cocked
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-04.png	one eyebrow. &quot;Actually she was brunette
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-05.png	at the roots and I had a redhead on
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-06.png	the other arm. He would have told
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-07.png	you this, too?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she laughed.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-08.png	&quot;He didn't actually see you. Because
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-09.png	it was your car I suppose he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-087/p03-087-10.png	presumed it was you, all dressed up in
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-00.png	&quot;My white or my black?&quot; Nigel enquired.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-01.png	&quot;Now I wonder which I wore at that
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-02.png	particular surgery?&quot; &quot;You are a fool,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-03.png	darling,&quot; Di said happily. &quot;I shall take
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-04.png	great pleasure in telling that young man
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-05.png	exactly what you were doing that
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-06.png	evening.&quot; &quot;No, don't,&quot; he said, after
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-07.png	kissing her again. &quot;I rather like to have
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-08.png	the housemen think of me as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-096/p03-096-09.png	two-timing Don Juan.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-00.png	I'm such a dull fellow, really.&quot; &quot;Dull?&quot; She
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-01.png	couldn't believe it. Self-deprecation
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-02.png	was not one of Nigel's usual attributes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-03.png	&quot;You need your holiday, darling. I only
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-04.png	wish I could go with you!&quot; &quot;Doctor
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-05.png	Wills, if you're making improper suggestions ...?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-06.png	&quot;It would make me more interesting,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-103/p03-103-07.png	I suppose?&quot; she enquired archly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-00.png	"No, it wouldn't!" he almost snapped,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-01.png	surprising her. "You sounded like some-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-02.png	body else for a moment there. It doesn't
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-03.png	become you to behave like a - a tart, Di."
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-04.png	"Nigel - !" she gasped. "I didn't mean to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-05.png	behave like anything of the kind. I
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-06.png	was only joking." "Well, don't. It's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-07.png	miserable enough my having to take my
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-08.png	leave in the autumn without you
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-112/p03-112-09.png	trying to be bright and gay about it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-00.png	Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-01.png	to have been guests at yesterday's
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-02.png	celebrations, and their friendly welcome
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-03.png	and warm sympathy, as she explained
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-04.png	how she had come to miss the party,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-05.png	made her send a complacent glance
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-06.png	in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-07.png	man was, she thought impatiently,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-08.png	trying to worry her into the belief
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-09.png	that her failure to appear at a function
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-151/n02-151-10.png	on the estate was a major error:
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-00.png	And then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-01.png	beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-02.png	toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin, told her
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-03.png	in halting 6patois that &quot;3Mistah Piers&quot; had
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-04.png	explained right at the start that &quot;3Mis' Beryl&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-05.png	would be 3&quot;plenty, plenty sad&quot; not to be back
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-154/n02-154-06.png	at the Villa in time.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-00.png	That it wouldn't be her fault at all. That
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-01.png	she was a lady who, like her Uncle Charles,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-02.png	took the highest pride in keeping her word. &quot;I
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-03.png	could see 3anudder 3t'ing,&quot; he went on in a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-04.png	lower voice, his sunken black eyes twinkling.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-05.png	3&quot;He powerful anxious, poor Mistah Piers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-06.png	We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-07.png	to all kin' o' boats, wid d'ose big, big
dataset/iam_lines/data/n02/n02-157/n02-157-08.png	rocks in an' out o' de water.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-00.png	He had almost entirely settled back into his old
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-01.png	ways, even to reading law about two hours each
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-02.png	day. Though he did not refuse wine, which the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-03.png	judge always had on the table at dinner, he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-04.png	did not act as though he found it necessary
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-05.png	except in moderate compliance with his father's
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-038/n03-038-06.png	habit.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-00.png	&quot;That boy! That damned fool boy! What does he mean
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-01.png	by trying to come home now, even if he did promise?
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-02.png	What does time mean when weighed against the life of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-03.png	two human beings?&quot; Not until he was certain that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-04.png	yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-05.png	being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-06.png	empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-066/n03-066-07.png	with part of that howling northwest gale.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-00.png	When the wind was on a rampage, as it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-01.png	now, it could kick up a sea-sized commotion
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-02.png	where it had a straight blow of eight miles
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-03.png	down the lake. 3&quot;Big blow, Judge,&quot; re-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-04.png	marked Willie Kim as the wind billowed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-05.png	out and sucked in his baggy black
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-079/n03-079-06.png	blouse and pantaloons.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-00.png	3&quot;Blow like hell. Maybe by and by
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-01.png	she blow some more.&quot; &quot;Hello, Willie, where
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-02.png	did you come from?&quot; the judge said in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-03.png	mild surprise. &quot;I didn't hear you. Do you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-04.png	see that fool boy of mine out there on
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-05.png	the lake?&quot; 3&quot;I see him. You don't need
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-06.png	worry, Judge. Big wind like that can't
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-082/n03-082-07.png	drown good man.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-00.png	Bill is good man, and Bueno Buck is raised on lake.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-01.png	He no drown, too. Him, his mother throw him into
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-02.png	water to make him swim when he is born.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-03.png	Maybe so Bill, he can swim that good, too.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-04.png	The yawl, riding the high waves with an air that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-05.png	might have made an ocean liner envious, seemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-06.png	prepared to make a safe though violent landing
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-07.png	when there came a sudden gust of wind
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-091/n03-091-08.png	from the west.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-00.png	&quot;Willie,&quot; the judge said huskily,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-01.png	&quot;that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-02.png	hip as I ever saw. That boy of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-03.png	mine seems to know how to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-04.png	everything, when he wants to.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-05.png	&quot;3Naw,&quot; disputed Willie. 3&quot;Just

dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-07.png	He plenty smart though.&quot; As they
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-08.png	reached the pier, the judge on legs
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-09.png	that were a little unsteady, they
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-10.png	found Bueno Buck, now on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-106/n03-106-11.png	pier, leading the yawl toward
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-00.png	&quot;Hello, Dad!&quot; Bill called. &quot;I hope you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-01.png	weren't worried. We're going to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-02.png	drag the boat ashore and turn
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-03.png	her over. She has a foot of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-04.png	water in her. I wouldn't be
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-05.png	surprised if we broke all
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-06.png	speed records on the way in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-07.png	Yes sir, I am slightly wet, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-08.png	Buck would be wetter if he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-113/n03-113-09.png	had more clothes on.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-00.png	With four doing the job and the waves
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-01.png	pushing at the stern, the yawl was soon
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-02.png	dragged out but before it was turned
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-03.png	over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-04.png	of water, tossed out a string of silvery
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-05.png	lake trout and said - 3&quot;Bill, he's better
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-06.png	man at catch 'em than Injun, Judge.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-07.png	You look. Little one more as fifteen
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-08.png	inches. Maybe big one four feet,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-120/n03-120-09.png	huh?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-00.png	&quot;By George, that is a beautiful string of fish!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-01.png	exclaimed the judge. &quot;Toss them on the grass
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-02.png	and then we'll all get hold and heave.&quot; A
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-03.png	few moments later the yawl was upside
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-126/n03-126-04.png	down, exposing its shallow keel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-00.png	A submariner's wife needed to be spared as much
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-01.png	as possible. Anyway the Parsifal affair was far
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-02.png	too fresh in both their minds to be a comfortable
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-03.png	subject for discussion. &quot;It's a command,&quot; he said.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-04.png	We can do with the extra money. It'll just about
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-05.png	pay Jacky's school fees.&quot; &quot;What shall we do
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-06.png	about this house? - and Jill's school? - and oh!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-015/n04-015-07.png	how I hate the Navy!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-00.png	If I'd known what it would be like I'd sooner
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-01.png	have married a parson.&quot; He kissed her. &quot;Parsons
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-02.png	work on Sundays,&quot; he said. &quot;They're worse off than
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-03.png	submariners. You ought to have married that fat
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-04.png	stockbroker chap and shared him with his three
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-05.png	mistresses. Anyway it might be much worse.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-06.png	Pericles is a Portsmouth boat. She spends longer
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-022/n04-022-07.png	in harbour than any other submarine.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-00.png	Practically a shore job. Cheer up.&quot; She wiped
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-01.png	her eyes and reached for her address book. &quot;I'll
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-02.png	write to those agents and try to get a flat in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-03.png	Alverstoke,&quot; she said. &quot;But I don't know what
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-04.png	Jill will say about leaving her school. It's a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-05.png	blessing that Jacky's off to boarding school.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-06.png	And all the trouble you've taken with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-031/n04-031-07.png	garden!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-00.png	That little beast, Robbie Munyard!&quot; Having
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-01.png	said her say Peggy manfully shouldered her
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-02.png	burden and prepared to break up yet
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-03.png	another home. In the ten years of married life
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-04.png	this had already happened half a dozen times.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-039/n04-039-05.png	Such is the life of a naval officer's wife.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-00.png	John's father had been a naval officer of the old
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-01.png	school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-02.png	on to the second generation. One of these was that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-03.png	an officer should join a ship, on taking up a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-04.png	new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-05.png	in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-06.png	It would have been acceptable to all concerned
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-07.png	if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-08.png	plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-09.png	instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-044/n04-044-10.png	sticking.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-00.png	So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-01.png	famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-02.png	interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-03.png	bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-04.png	baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-05.png	went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-06.png	empty, save for the lady known by all habitue
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-07.png	*?2s as 'Seaweed', and a youngish, sharp-eyed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-08.png	man who was staring moodily into a gin
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-048/n04-048-09.png	and tonic.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-00.png	Seaweed's memory was prodigious; her manner
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-01.png	must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-02.png	of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-03.png	than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-04.png	glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-05.png	of the bar was not 6persona grata. If her
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-06.png	memory was good, so was this stranger's.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-07.png	"You're Commander Winter," he said. "Have a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-052/n04-052-08.png	gin?" He turned to Seaweed -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-00.png	"Make it a large one, darling. I know the naval
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-01.png	habits. 'Drink gin and call each other wallahs,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-02.png	what!' - as the Guards officer said on his return
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-03.png	from a visit to the Royal Navy. Submarines, what.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-04.png	Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Crawled
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-05.png	inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-060/n04-060-06.png	bomb. Should have been a V.C.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-00.png	What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-01.png	obviously thirsty.&quot; John fought back his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-02.png	inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-03.png	would have to leave the bar and either sit in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-04.png	the lounge or return to his bedroom.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-05.png	Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-06.png	came to the rescue. &quot;You haven't introduced
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-068/n04-068-07.png	yourself,&quot; she said with mock severity.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-00.png	"It's a rule on these premises. No treating with
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-01.png	strangers - that's right, John, isn't it?" "My
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-02.png	fault entirely," said the stranger. "It's my conceited
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-03.png	nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-04.png	was. I'm Ian Bawley. Does that mean anything
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-05.png	to you?" It did. Ian Bawley's name was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-06.png	printed at the head of most naval articles
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-075/n04-075-07.png	in the Daily Courier.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-00.png	John flushed. &quot;I'm not in need of charity.&quot; &quot;Come
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-01.png	off it,&quot; said Bawley. &quot;The proprietor of the Daily
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-02.png	Courier knows what's going on. If he doesn't mind,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-03.png	why should you?&quot; &quot;I see.&quot; John took the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-04.png	refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-130/n04-130-05.png	companion. &quot;You want me to talk, is that it?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-00.png	&quot;You misjudge me,&quot; said Bawley. &quot;You have
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-01.png	nothing to tell me, yet. But we'll be meeting
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-02.png	again, no doubt, and then you will have.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-03.png	Regard this as a softening-up process, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-04.png	have dinner with me? On His Lordship,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-05.png	of course.&quot; &quot;On one condition,&quot; said John.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-06.png	&quot;Tell me who the little bird was.&quot; &quot;Can't
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-07.png	you guess? Whose portrait appears regularly
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-139/n04-139-08.png	in the shiny papers?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-00.png	"You mean Munyard?" "Sure. Very useful
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-01.png	contact, is our Robbie; he gives us the gen and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-02.png	we give him the publicity. 'The Honourable
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-03.png	"Robbie" and friend', what? You know the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-04.png	sort of thing." "You'll get nothing out of me,"
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-05.png	said John, "but you can pay for my drinks
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-06.png	if you want to, as long as you keep off
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-149/n04-149-07.png	Service matters."
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-00.png	&quot;Good-oh! One for the grill-room, darling, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-01.png	tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-02.png	Bawley was a man of his word. He kept
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-03.png	away from Service matters, was an excellent
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-04.png	host and a splendid raconteur. The evening
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-05.png	passed all too quickly. As they parted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-06.png	the vestibule the two men were well
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-156/n04-156-07.png	disposed towards each other.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-00.png	&quot;Ever been to Fleet Street?&quot; asked Bawley.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-01.png	&quot;You should. Next time you're in Town
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-02.png	give me a ring at this number and I'll
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-03.png	take you round the pubs where most
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-04.png	of the work is done.&quot; He held out a card.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-05.png	John took it and put it in his pocket.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-06.png	&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;If ever my missus
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-07.png	lets me off the chain I'll take you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-163/n04-163-08.png	up on that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-00.png	Ever been out in a submarine? I'll give
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-01.png	you a spin round one of these days, if you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-02.png	like. You could write it up.&quot; Bawley made a face.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-03.png	&quot;Not in Pericles, old man.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-04.png	&quot;Better ask Robbie Munyard.&quot; &quot;What's he been
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-05.png	saying?&quot; John was furious. The little squirt!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-171/n04-171-06.png	To go gassing to a newspaper man!
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-00.png	&quot;Look!&quot; he went on earnestly. &quot;You're not going
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-01.png	to write up Pericles in some way or other, are
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-02.png	you?&quot; &quot;What is there to write up?&quot; said
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-03.png	Bawley. &quot;There are forty-three submarines in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-04.png	the Navy - why should I pick on Pericles?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-05.png	John eyed him steadily. &quot;It's the Parcifal
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-183/n04-183-06.png	business, isn't it?&quot; he said quietly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-00.png	"I don't want it to happen again," said Bawley -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-01.png	"more so than ever since I met you."
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-02.png	"What did Munyard say?" "The Snort - hull
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-03.png	fitting fractured." "Supposing I was to tell you that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-04.png	we've had Pericles' entire Snort equipment removed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-05.png	and X-rayed and that it was as sound as a bell?"
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-190/n04-190-06.png	said John.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-00.png	&quot;Munyard didn't tell me that. But I must confess
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-01.png	I'm relieved. But it still doesn't do away
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-02.png	with the possibility of faulty design.&quot; He held
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-03.png	out his hand. &quot;Maybe I will take a trip with you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-04.png	one of these days,&quot; he said. &quot;In the meantime
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-195/n04-195-05.png	I'll tell my editor that the story's a dead bird.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-00.png	Glad I met you. Don't forget to give me a ring -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-01.png	any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley, what?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-02.png	&quot;I don't know when that will be,&quot; said John.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-03.png	&quot;I shall be busy for a while, cleaning up after
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-04.png	Master bloody Munyard.&quot; THERE were six submarines,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-05.png	lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-06.png	Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-07.png	sounded, for all of them were rumbling as they
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-202/n04-202-08.png	charged their electric batteries.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-00.png	A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-01.png	through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-02.png	pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-03.png	Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-04.png	a substantial breakfast. Although usually a very
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-05.png	talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-06.png	silences, for she knew they betokened a worry of
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-209/n04-209-07.png	some sort.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-00.png	There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-01.png	affair of Parsifal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-02.png	His normal placid and steady-going manner remained,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-03.png	but she could see that it no longer came naturally.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-04.png	It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-05.png	to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-06.png	though in peace time these happenings are few and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-213/n04-213-07.png	far between.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-00.png	This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-01.png	a national disaster and then when it is all over life
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-02.png	must continue as before. During this period the Captain
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-03.png	must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-04.png	if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-05.png	written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-06.png	locality, had been interviewed by the Press, had driven
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-07.png	his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-08.png	usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-218/n04-218-09.png	suitable for such occasions.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-00.png	He rode down to where I was waiting. I was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-01.png	thinking what a skill he had for reading
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-02.png	my mind. &quot;This would be as good a place
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-03.png	for a hold-up as any,&quot; he said, reining in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-04.png	near me. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;It'll be here to-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-05.png	morrow as likely as not.&quot; I paused. &quot;Miss
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-074/n06-074-06.png	Jeannie'll be on that coach, Dan.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-00.png	&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;I know.&quot; &quot;No harm must come
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-01.png	to her, Dan.&quot; &quot;She'll be all right. It's the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-02.png	men who'll be after that coach I'm interested
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-03.png	in, Johnny.&quot; &quot;I know. But if lead starts
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-04.png	flying she might be in danger.&quot; &quot;That's so.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-05.png	But I reckon they'll be too busy shooting at
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-06.png	us to bother with the coach and the folks
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-082/n06-082-07.png	in it.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-00.png	&quot;Maybe,&quot; I said. &quot;But we've got to remember
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-01.png	that girl all the time, Dan. I feel kind
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-02.png	of responsible for her.&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; he said,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-03.png	giving me one of his strange looks. Then he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-04.png	turned the conversation. &quot;Let's ride over
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-05.png	and have a look at the mining camp.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-06.png	After all it's them we're supposed to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-07.png	working for, as well as the townsfolk and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-092/n06-092-08.png	the agency detective.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-00.png	With something of a start I remembered the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-01.png	man who'd brought us into this business.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-02.png	&quot;Maybe you don't know about Appleton,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-03.png	Dan?&quot; &quot;Know what?&quot; &quot;That he's dead,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-04.png	I said. I watched him because I was always
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-05.png	fascinated by the way he looked when you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-06.png	tried to surprise him. &quot;Dead?&quot; he said. &quot;Yes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-07.png	Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-08.png	down with a shotgun outside the Palace
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-100/n06-100-09.png	last night.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-00.png	&quot;Fenton or Somers,&quot; he said. &quot;Or the Town
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-01.png	Marshal,&quot; I added. His face was fixed,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-02.png	unreadable as a rock. &quot;Let's get over to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-03.png	mining camp,&quot; he said abruptly. He wheeled
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-04.png	his horse back off the trail and up the slope
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-05.png	leading to the ridge. I followed. From the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-06.png	top you could see something of the wild hill
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-111/n06-111-07.png	country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-00.png	The air was fresh and clear and you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-01.png	could see far over west and north for many
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-02.png	miles. The real high country of the Rockies
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-03.png	lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-04.png	colour drawing. Between us and that lay
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-05.png	a vast stretch of hills, canyons, buttes and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-119/n06-119-06.png	malpais.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-00.png	&quot;The mine-workings lie north of the town,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-01.png	said Dan. &quot;If we head west we ought to
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-02.png	cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-03.png	So we swung west, making slow going over
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-04.png	rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-05.png	into draws, circling a big mesa by a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-06.png	four or five mile valley, sandy-floored. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-07.png	got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-08.png	gratefully by a small creek where we watered
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-09.png	the horses and drank enough to cure our
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-123/n06-123-10.png	thirst.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-00.png	An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-01.png	we figured would lead to the miners' camp.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-02.png	We turned north into it and after about four
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-03.png	miles it led into a small canyon which
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-04.png	opened out into a wide shallow draw.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-05.png	Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-06.png	the miners at work. They were scattered
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-07.png	over a fairly wide area working singly or
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-128/n06-128-08.png	in pairs.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-00.png	We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-01.png	of the diggings there was a roughly-built
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-02.png	shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-03.png	out, &quot;If you come any closer, I'll sure blow
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-04.png	your whiskers off.&quot; &quot;Take it easy, mister,&quot; I sang
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-05.png	out. &quot;We don't aim to come any closer and we've
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-06.png	got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-07.png	go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-133/n06-133-08.png	to him about what happened last night.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-00.png	&quot;Oh,&quot; said the unseen guard. He blew a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-01.png	whistle then, loud and shrill. The gun barrel
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-02.png	peeking out through a hole in the shack never
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-03.png	wavered. We sat our horses, waiting. &quot;Looks as
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-04.png	though they're expecting trouble,&quot; I said. &quot;Where
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-05.png	there's gold and women there's always trouble,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-06.png	observed Dan, shifting about in his saddle. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-140/n06-140-07.png	was never long on patience.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-00.png	Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-01.png	of the church where there was a small open
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-02.png	outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-03.png	and forks and tidying up implements. It might
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-04.png	be open. It was. He entered, and seated himself
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-05.png	in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-06.png	His curious headgear fell off. Strange things
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-07.png	were going on in his bewildered brain. When
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-08.png	a man was drowning and towards his last
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-09.png	gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-10.png	life came up before him in some cinematic
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-147/p01-147-11.png	kind of sequence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-00.png	Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-01.png	outbuilding, but this was happening to him now. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-02.png	saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed, repressed
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-03.png	boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-04.png	baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-05.png	Walking out of the chapel later on. Continuing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-06.png	on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-07.png	canery and corruption, the growth of the dea-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-08.png	dly decadence and absorption in debase-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-155/p01-155-09.png	ment and Satanic debauchery.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-00.png	He didn't know what to make of it, but it
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-01.png	was Mr. Copthorne all right. Perhaps he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-02.png	been attending some kind of fancy dress do
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-03.png	in London. Very strange his eyes looked. Mad,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-04.png	hunted eyes, as if the poor fellow had rocks in
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-05.png	his head, so the verger described afterwards.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-06.png	&quot;You're very early about, sir,&quot; he said, trying to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-168/p01-168-07.png	speak normally.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-00.png	"Yes. I travelled down from London
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-01.png	as the dawn was breaking, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-02.png	the thought came to me I'd like
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-03.png	to take a look at the church. I've
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-04.png	never been inside. Very remiss of
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-05.png	me," said Mr. Copthorne. The verger
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-06.png	led the way in. "The stained glass
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-07.png	windows, sir, they date back to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p01/p01-174/p01-174-08.png	the fourteenth century."
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-00.png	There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-01.png	quickly through the customs. &quot;Gay!&quot; &quot;Gavin!&quot; The girl
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-02.png	and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-03.png	together. The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-04.png	taxi. &quot;Just a moment, darling,&quot; Gavin pressed her
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-05.png	hand and smiled. &quot;I want to check up on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-000/p02-000-06.png	flights back.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-00.png	Gay, sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-01.png	hardly believe that she was the same girl,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-02.png	miserable, shy, who had sat at the little
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-03.png	table for the first time a few days ago.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-04.png	Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-05.png	and Gay's heart turned over. &quot;I'd like
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-06.png	to do that.&quot; Gavin drained his glass
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-017/p02-017-07.png	and refilled it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-00.png	&quot;And then we'll go for a stroll along the
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-01.png	beach. A moon like this mustn't be wasted.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-02.png	He gestured towards the bay where the full
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-03.png	moon was just rising over the rocks, then
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-04.png	laid his hand on hers. Gay smiled at him
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-05.png	again, happy beyond belief, knowing that
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-06.png	now Gavin was in love with her and her
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-07.png	only, yet remembering for a second the
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-022/p02-022-08.png	kisses she had seen him giving Elaine.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-00.png	Gay thanked him and walked out on to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-01.png	the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-02.png	had bought a drink and taken it outside.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-03.png	She looked round scanning the tables,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-04.png	then caught her breath, a cold hand
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-05.png	seeming to clutch her heart. Gavin was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-06.png	seated at a small table in a shadowy
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-07.png	corner talking animatedly to Simone.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-08.png	As Gay watched he offered the girl a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-09.png	cigarette and lit it, his hands cupping
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-076/p02-076-10.png	hers in an intimate way.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-00.png	Gay stood irresolute for a moment, half
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-01.png	decided to go back and join Lilyan and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-02.png	Doc, while she wanted to do no more than
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-03.png	run upstairs to her room, knowing that
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-04.png	Gavin although he had told her that he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-05.png	loved her, was already flirting with a girl
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-06.png	that he had only met a few minutes before.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-07.png	Larry's advice flashed through her mind,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-08.png	but she turned away, giving a little
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-081/p02-081-09.png	gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-00.png	As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-01.png	and Simone go through the doorway that led
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-02.png	down to the beach. Gay closed her eyes for a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-03.png	moment in disgust. She was fully aware that Gavin
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-04.png	would make love to the French girl on the sands,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-05.png	and no doubt he would come back soon and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-06.png	after Simone had left expect her to accept his
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-105/p02-105-07.png	kisses on the way back to the hotel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-00.png	Doc gave her hand a shake. &quot;Wake up
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-01.png	Gay, and don't even contemplate throwing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-02.png	yourself away on a chap like that. You're a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-03.png	fine girl, intelligent, and pretty, and I had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-04.png	thought you were sensible too. Don't
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-05.png	make a fool of yourself over someone
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-06.png	who doesn't care two jots for your feelings.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-07.png	If he behaves like this now what is your
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-115/p02-115-08.png	married life going to be like?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-00.png	Hell.&quot; Doc answered for her. &quot;Just Hell. Never able to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-01.png	trust him out of your sight and having to put on
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-02.png	a brave face and pretend that you don't mind
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-03.png	whenever he flirts with another woman. He will
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-04.png	you know, always, and you aren't the type
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-121/p02-121-05.png	who is tough enough to change him.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-00.png	Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-01.png	again Gay found herself alone at the table
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-02.png	feeling self-conscious and awkward, sure that
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-03.png	people were talking about the way Gavin
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-04.png	was behaving since they had seen them
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-05.png	dining together. She opened her bag
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-06.png	to get out her compact and saw Grace's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-07.png	letter. She drew it out and opened it,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-135/p02-135-08.png	glad to be able to occupy herself.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-00.png	No other news except that Elaine is engaged
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-01.png	and going to marry a foreigner ...&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-02.png	Gay read the rest of the letter then put
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-03.png	it back in her bag. Elaine was engaged,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-04.png	to the man she had spent so much time
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-05.png	with at her party. That was why
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-06.png	Gavin had come back to her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-07.png	Everything was quite clear now, and to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-08.png	her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-09.png	rather a sense of relief now that she
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-10.png	knew why Gavin had come to see
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-144/p02-144-11.png	her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-00.png	Because she was second best. The others came back
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-01.png	to the table, all of them making a fuss of her and at once
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-02.png	she felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm sympathy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-03.png	knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new ones.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-04.png	&quot;That is a pretty dress,&quot; Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-05.png	Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-06.png	understand, knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-07.png	for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-150/p02-150-08.png	was hurt for herself.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-155/p02-155-00.png	&quot;I made it myself,&quot; Gay tried to speak
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-155/p02-155-01.png	normally.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-00.png	Diana Wills often sat on the brand
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-01.png	new seat outside the hospital
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-02.png	gates and thought vagrant
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-03.png	thoughts. At one time she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-04.png	watched the workmen constructing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-05.png	the roundabout, which was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-06.png	to put St. John's Casualty Department
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-07.png	out of operation - in theory, at
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-08.png	least. She would think of her-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-09.png	self as a stranger in these parts
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-10.png	studying these cross-roads. Which
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-004/p03-004-11.png	one to take?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-00.png	&quot;If I were a tramp I would simply blow a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-01.png	feather,&quot; she decided, rather envying the gentle-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-02.png	man of the road his freedom of decision, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-03.png	wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-04.png	women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-05.png	airy directions accordingly. &quot;If I were needing a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-009/p03-009-06.png	job I'd go to London, of course,&quot; she went on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-00.png	&quot;There are all sorts of wonder-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-01.png	ful jobs in London and I could
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-02.png	take my pick, whereas in Yarmouth
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-03.png	one has to know something about fishing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-04.png	and in Liverpool they'd want sea-farers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-05.png	I don't think I'd go to Edinburgh un-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-06.png	less I was a Scot and wanting to get
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-07.png	home, or perhaps a student studying to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-08.png	be a doctor, and I already know
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-012/p03-012-09.png	all about that.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-00.png	She was engaged to Nigel, had been for two years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-01.png	Sometimes they talked on the theme of &quot;when we get married&quot;,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-02.png	and then all was wonderful, and perhaps it had only been
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-03.png	a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said, only last
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-04.png	evening, &quot;If we get married, old girl, you'll have to stop
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-023/p03-023-05.png	that lark, I can tell you!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-00.png	She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-01.png	which 'lark' she would have to stop, only that significant tiny
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-02.png	word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-03.png	with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-04.png	which now took on an ominous significance: Nigel had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-05.png	seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-06.png	been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-027/p03-027-07.png	Little Phelpham.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-00.png	Now Nigel had every right to go where he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-01.png	liked during his off-duty periods
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-02.png	when she was not free; this much they had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-03.png	conceded one to the other. They rarely
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-04.png	found they were off duty together, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-05.png	the situation would have been intolerable
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-06.png	had there not been some give and take
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-07.png	about their relationship. So when Nigel
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-08.png	had told her about taking Luke's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-029/p03-029-09.png	evening surgery she had said,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-00.png	&quot;Hardly likely, my sweet. Luke's surgery goes on for
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-01.png	hours. If they get in before eight-thirty, even
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-02.png	though they're standing on one another's toes,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-03.png	I've got to see 'em. If I am free, though,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-04.png	I'll give you a ring, O.K.?&quot; O.K.,&quot; she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-05.png	replied readily. So how could Nigel have
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-06.png	been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-07.png	dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-040/p03-040-08.png	very evening?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-00.png	&quot;No,&quot; she told Phil Gubbins, a junior
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-01.png	houseman, &quot;it wasn't Nigel you saw,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-02.png	my lad.&quot; &quot;It was Nigel's car, anyway.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-03.png	NUF 121.&quot; &quot;He probably loaned his car
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-04.png	to somebody, Phil. He's always doing that.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-05.png	Young Gubbins shrugged. &quot;I didn't see his
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-06.png	face, Di, but it certainly looked like
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-07.png	Nigel from the back. D.j. and all.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-08.png	Of course such as I couldn't afford
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-047/p03-047-09.png	to go into the Load of Trouble.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-00.png	But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-01.png	realised it was important enough for her to have remembered, and it
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-02.png	was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-03.png	made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-04.png	&quot;Nigel,&quot; she had besought him, &quot;you know that evening
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-05.png	you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-069/p03-069-06.png	with a cyst on her ear ... ?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-00.png	&quot;5Ye-es?&quot; he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-01.png	mouth, an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-02.png	&quot;What about it, my sweet?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; she laughed
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-03.png	suddenly in an upsurging of relief, &quot;that stupid
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-04.png	Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-05.png	With a blonde, too. Imagine!&quot; Nigel was frowning. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-06.png	looked distinguished when he frowned; boyishly
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-072/p03-072-07.png	handsome at other times.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-00.png	&quot;Gubbins? Gubbins?&quot; he fretted. &quot;Who's he?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-01.png	Though Diana knew the name of every
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-02.png	member of the staff, distinguished or not,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-03.png	Nigel often had to think hard to sort
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-04.png	them out. &quot;He's the carrotty lad, isn't he?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-05.png	he now demanded. &quot;What was he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-080/p03-080-06.png	doing at the Load of Trouble?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-00.png	I'm going with a shooting party. What else can I do
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-01.png	at this time of year? I can't ask you up because it's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-02.png	a strictly stag affair.&quot; &quot;I know. I didn't expect ...&quot; &quot;Well,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-03.png	don't keep hinting, then. You wish you could
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-04.png	come with me; you hope I'll miss you; you
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-05.png	can't imagine the hospital without me for
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-121/p03-121-06.png	three weeks, etcetera, etcetera!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-00.png	Her figure was small and exquisite, like a schoolgirl's still, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-01.png	he admired her legs, which the male sex were inclined to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-02.png	regard first. &quot;I would mind if you didn't&quot; he told her
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-03.png	grimly, and tugged her fiercely into his arms. &quot;You're
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-04.png	right, pet. I do need this leave. I'm bad-tempered and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-05.png	broody and going out with brash blondes. I don't deserve
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-135/p03-135-06.png	you.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-00.png	"Darling!" her voiced caressed him. "Moments like this
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-01.png	make all the waiting worth while. When we're
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-02.png	married we won't have these explosions of emotion,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-03.png	will we?" "No," he eyed her strangely. "I wish we
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-04.png	were married, Di. Like a patient wishes his operation
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-05.png	was over." Again her laughter trilled. "Marriage
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-142/p03-142-06.png	isn't as bad as an operation, Nigel!"
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-00.png	&quot;Isn't it?&quot; he rose and smoothed himself
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-01.png	down. &quot;Ask any bridegroom-to-be. Anyhow,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-02.png	that particular problem isn't looming at
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-03.png	the moment, thank God!&quot; Problem ... ?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-04.png	looming ... ? &quot;Are we discussing a marriage
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-05.png	or a burial?&quot; she asked, hardly believing
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-06.png	he could be serious. &quot;Surely marrying
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-151/p03-151-07.png	me isn't going to be all that bad?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-00.png	If it is -&quot; she laughed uncertainly - &quot;you can have
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-01.png	your ring back.&quot; She loosened the half-hoop of
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-02.png	diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-03.png	out to him, still playfully. Without a glimmer
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-04.png	of amusement in his own eyes, however, he took
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-05.png	it, looking moodily beyond her. &quot;Perhaps it's as
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-06.png	well if you don't wear it for a bit, Di,&quot; he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-158/p03-158-07.png	told her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-00.png	"But I want it!" she protested. "It's my ring."
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-01.png	"You just gave it back to me." "I
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-02.png	didn't! I was joking. You know I was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-03.png	joking, Nigel." "You shouldn't joke
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-04.png	about serious things like engagements."
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-05.png	"Don't be such a baby!" They were going
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-06.png	to have an open quarrel
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-163/p03-163-07.png	any minute, and she knew it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-00.png	Almost in desperation she appealed, &quot;Will you meet
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-01.png	me at the gate, four o'clock tomorrow?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-02.png	enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair. &quot;To bring
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-03.png	me up for tea, of course. I just thought.&quot; &quot;I'll see,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-04.png	he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-05.png	which really hurt. &quot;Without your ring it's just like
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-06.png	kissing somebody else's girl,&quot; he decided wickedly,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-07.png	and kissed her again, somewhat startled to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-173/p03-173-08.png	receive a sharp slap for his pains.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-00.png	&quot;If I were somebody else's girl that's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-01.png	what you'd get,&quot; she flashed at him, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-02.png	so had left him, on her dignity and not
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-03.png	seeing the look of admiration and revelation
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-04.png	which had followed her slim young figure
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-05.png	out of his sight. &quot;Mine,&quot; Nigel Lester had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-06.png	decided with a sigh of satisfaction, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-07.png	then regarded the ring which he retrieved
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-08.png	from his pocket. &quot;At a price,&quot; he concluded,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-181/p03-181-09.png	with some bitterness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-00.png	His mouth hardened, his eyes became
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-01.png	steely. 'I see.' Scorn lashed his
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-02.png	words. 'I wonder you dared trust
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-03.png	him to my care.' 'Nicholas -'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-04.png	'Well! At least I know the truth.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-05.png	Truth!' His gaze held hers
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-06.png	masterfully. 'You wanted it so
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-07.png	badly - at any price. I hope
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-030/p06-030-08.png	you are satisfied.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-00.png	And as he spoke, the thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-01.png	of Philip lying in the other
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-02.png	room filled him with a re-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-03.png	vulsion that was homicidal.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-04.png	Even in that, his hands were
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-05.png	tied. He dare not precipitate
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-06.png	what might well be another
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-07.png	coronary. And in that second
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-08.png	he put back his professional
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-09.png	mantle, and said with such
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-042/p06-042-10.png	icy politeness, such withdrawn
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-00.png	'I will leave you the necessary pre-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-01.png	scription for the sedatives. You
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-02.png	will contact your new doctor
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-03.png	when you reach your parents'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-04.png	house.' She watched him flick
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-05.png	his fountain-pen from his
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-06.png	waistcoat pocket, take out
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-07.png	his # prescription pad, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-08.png	# scribble on it. Then,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-09.png	with a gesture she knew so well,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-047/p06-047-10.png	he tore off the leaflet and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-00.png	'Good-bye, Sandra,' he said
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-01.png	with a deadly finality. Watching
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-02.png	him go, unable to speak, she
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-03.png	felt that part of her was leaving
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-04.png	him. She couldn't hate him...
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-05.png	If only he would have con-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-06.png	fided in her, given some expla-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-07.png	nation. Now there was no-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-052/p06-052-08.png	thing - not even friendship.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-00.png	She went back to Philip. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-01.png	all she could hear were Nicholas's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-02.png	words: 'I love you - oh, you
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-03.png	know that well enough.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-04.png	Love. She revolted against
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-05.png	the word. Nicholas, Philip...
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-06.png	where was happiness, or
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-07.png	peace of mind? Philip put out
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-08.png	a hand and grasped hers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-09.png	He needed her. She would find
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-058/p06-058-10.png	solace in that fact at least.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-00.png	She had her truth. How much had built
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-01.png	up from that first ideal, and how
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-02.png	little joy, or satisfaction, it had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-03.png	given her. 'I'm sorry, darling.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-04.png	He looked nervous. It had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-05.png	hell lying there, knowing she was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-06.png	talking to Nicholas and wondering
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-07.png	what they were saying. Sandra
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-08.png	said instinctively: 'I told him
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-09.png	I knew he was responsible for
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-069/p06-069-10.png	Beryl's death.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-00.png	Her eyes darkened in torment. 'Are
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-01.png	you sure that she was telling the truth?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-02.png	'Good heavens, darling, why on earth
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-03.png	should she lie? Besides, it wasn't just
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-04.png	her word. There was enough evidence,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-05.png	no matter how one might want to
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-06.png	disbelieve the facts.' Elation
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-07.png	touched him after the cold wind
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-08.png	of suspense. 'It will be interesting
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-088/p06-088-09.png	to see what comes out at the inquest.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-00.png	What his story will be. I reckon
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-01.png	he'll confine himself to the nervous
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-02.png	origin of her recent illness. His notes
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-03.png	will be truthful, but what he leaves out
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-04.png	will matter most.' Strange how just
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-05.png	then Philip was so certain that Nicholas
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-06.png	would never betray him. He loved
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-07.png	Sandra too deeply to ruin her
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-08.png	future happiness. Had ever circum-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-09.png	stances conspired so cunningly?
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-096/p06-096-10.png	Philip's spirits soared.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-00.png	He was better; he had made a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-01.png	miraculous recovery and Sandra would
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-02.png	soon be his wife. The Devil, he thought,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-03.png	certainly looked after his own.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-04.png	Something in Sandra's attitude struck
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-05.png	him suddenly, making him say:
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-06.png	'You can't forgive him for this -
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-07.png	can you?' 'Forgive is an unctuous,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-08.png	patronizing word,' she replied. 'I despise
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-104/p06-104-09.png	the deceit. The lies.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-00.png	Philip bristled. 'It was never our intention
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-01.png	to have one of those carnival affairs,' he
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-02.png	retorted and in that second, he became the man of
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-03.png	success exerting authority. Sandra watched her father's
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-04.png	face pale. Philip, she knew, got on his nerves, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-05.png	everything had gone over her head. It didn't really
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-06.png	matter what was being said because she was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-242/p06-242-07.png	no longer a part of it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-00.png	The thought of Nicholas haunted her, the sense of
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-01.png	loss crucifying. Her father's comment roused her as
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-02.png	he said, 'I was not talking of a carnival. But I
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-03.png	presume we shall be allowed to have one or two
dataset/iam_lines/data/p06/p06-248/p06-248-04.png	of our friends at the ceremony.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-00.png	Vence is a sober spot, half way between small
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-01.png	town and village, pigeon grey, sly with arches, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-02.png	linked by a whispering plot of fountains. In the main
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-03.png	tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-04.png	sunshine, still burning like a half-cooled iron,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-000/r06-000-05.png	sip pastis and read the local newspapers.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-00.png	One called La Patriote is Communist, and at the time
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-01.png	of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-02.png	tomatoes at General de Gaulle. One side of this square
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-03.png	is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar. For one
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-04.png	day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-05.png	hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-06.png	elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-003/r06-003-07.png	had firmly closed the door in our noses.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-00.png	'It is a pity,' said Mart, 'because it would have been
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-01.png	a good address.' Now, after a woman's radar look,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-02.png	she decided Pierre would solve our problems. This
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-03.png	was true, Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al, thin and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-04.png	yellow as lemon peel, wrestling with some gnawing rat
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-05.png	of an illness, man of all trades, married to a commanding
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-06.png	lady who loved small talk and the discreet
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-007/r06-007-07.png	accumulation of money.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-00.png	We went in. There were a few people in the bar,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-01.png	elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a hard
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-02.png	bargain for giving up. 'I have furnished rooms,' said
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-03.png	Pierre, 'and all mod cons.' The price was 16,000 francs a
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-04.png	month. 'Yes,' we said immediately, even before viewing.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-011/r06-011-05.png	We were shown around by Pierre.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-00.png	The flat was on the third floor; two rooms; soft Provenc*?
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-01.png	6al view; good intimate furnishing and colour; running
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-02.png	hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-03.png	basin and bidet; own private, modern lavatory. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-04.png	first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-05.png	We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-018/r06-018-06.png	eruption of turtle-doves.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-00.png	This was strange, even magic, because the owner's
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-01.png	name was Pierre Tortorolo which, in Nicoison Italian means
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-02.png	'turtledove'. Pierre Turtledove. When we woke up properly it
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-03.png	was raining, an even more hopeless rain than London, and we
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-04.png	looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-05.png	curling white breath of the mountains. The land looked
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-06.png	like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-022/r06-022-07.png	shame.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-00.png	There they were, in fact, below us, eight of them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-01.png	Four of them were flattened on the window sills, two
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-02.png	immolated on a nearby roof top, the other pair copulating.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-03.png	We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-04.png	Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-05.png	Lawrence. He was here, near the railway station, three or
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-06.png	four years. During this period he wrote a book,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-027/r06-027-07.png	The Lover of Lady Chatterly.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-00.png	In the train going back to London I sat
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-01.png	beside # Catherine. She had the stories open
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-02.png	in front of her, but she said: 'Philip's awfully lucky.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-03.png	I wish I went to that school. Did you notice
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-143/r06-143-04.png	that girl who said hullo to him in the garden?
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-00.png	He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-01.png	drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-02.png	self-employed. By the time his monthly salary
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-03.png	arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-04.png	their share, and there were precious few
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-05.png	reductions in tax save for wives, children,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-06.png	life-insurances or any of the other normal
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-000/r02-000-07.png	encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-00.png	He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-01.png	provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-02.png	to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-03.png	postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-04.png	was ended, audited and agreed by the Inspector. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-003/r02-003-05.png	process could, and often did take several years.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-00.png	At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-01.png	had claimed tax relief on the pur-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-02.png	chase of several mink coats which,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-03.png	it seemed, were necessary to fur-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-04.png	ther her career. Alternatively, it
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-05.png	was reported, she tearfully claimed
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-06.png	that the warm coats were heating
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-07.png	appliances and therefore susceptible
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-08.png	to a depreciation tax allowance
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-006/r02-006-09.png	as plant and machinery. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-00.png	Between all the interested parties, the final
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-01.png	agreement had been delayed long enough for
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-02.png	Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-03.png	by rights should have been reserved for her tax.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-04.png	Discounting one chinchilla jacket, a Rolls-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-05.png	Royce and a Sussex manor house, all
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-06.png	three of which were in her husband's name,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-010/r02-010-07.png	she now declared herself bankrupt.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-00.png	'It's not mine. I wasn't sitting there.' She blinked
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-01.png	disdainfully at him and stepped out.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-02.png	It was a new briefcase, and as the train jogged along
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-03.png	the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-04.png	He wondered what it contained. Probably the remains
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-05.png	of someone's lunch or a few secret files.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-038/r02-038-06.png	He smiled at his own joke.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-00.png	Cecil searched in his pockets once
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-01.png	more and came up with two
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-02.png	paper-clips. After a few seconds
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-03.png	of twisting, he roughly thrust a
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-04.png	bent wire loop into the lock and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-05.png	waggled it around vigorously.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-06.png	There was a click and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-07.png	briefcase opened. Cecil thrust an
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-08.png	eager hand inside, his fingers
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-09.png	groping after wads of five
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-060/r02-060-10.png	pound notes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-00.png	Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-01.png	printing to find no Govr., no Compa., in fact no five pound notes
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-02.png	at all. He was holding a paper booklet, the top sheet of which
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-03.png	bore, in large Baskerville type, the words METROPOLITAN
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-04.png	MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-05.png	COURSE NO. 3. He ruffled the sheets irritably and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-070/r02-070-06.png	glowered at his own breach of social morality.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-00.png	He climbed the stairs, eager to unload the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-01.png	guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-02.png	to emerge carrying his shame unseen, but burning,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-03.png	into the night. He reached the barrier and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-04.png	fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-05.png	briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-06.png	intention of playing the dutiful citizen
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-078/r02-078-07.png	retrieving lost property.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-00.png	'HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day?' His mother came into
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-01.png	the hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-02.png	and, turning his back to her, contrived to slide the brief-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-03.png	case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-04.png	and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-05.png	which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-06.png	brella stand. 'You're later than usual, aren't you?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-07.png	His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-08.png	they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-09.png	for the labels from half a hundredweight of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-089/r02-089-10.png	Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-00.png	Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-01.png	inequity of Miss Cheesecake well-nigh bathing
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-02.png	in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-03.png	easy on the immersion heater. 'What is it,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-04.png	Cecil? Don't you feel well?' his mother
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-05.png	asked solicitously. 'You do look tired.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-06.png	Go and get yourself a drink.' 'Don't
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-07.png	fuss, mother! I'm quite well and no more
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-08.png	tired than usual, and we finished the gin
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-109/r02-109-09.png	last week, you know that.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-00.png	Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-01.png	of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-02.png	who is nearly bald is no longer a baby. He started to
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-03.png	climb the stairs, stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-04.png	the treads. 'And don't wipe the dirt off on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-127/r02-127-05.png	towel like you did yesterday.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-00.png	Your Auntie Edie's coming in for a cup of tea later and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-01.png	you know how she has a good look round everywhere.' There was
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-02.png	a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard. Cecil's
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-03.png	mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-04.png	against the brass umbrella stand. 'Well now!' She hurried
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-131/r02-131-05.png	towards it and picked it up.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-00.png	'What have we here? A new briefcase! So THAT'S
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-01.png	what it's all about.' Cecil halted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-02.png	mid-step near the top of the stairs and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-03.png	clenched his fists. 'So that's what
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-04.png	What's all about?' he hissed without
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-05.png	turning round. She pointed to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-06.png	briefcase. 'So that's why you are so
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-07.png	irritable. You thought that I'd think
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-137/r02-137-08.png	you'd been extravagant.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-00.png	'But I'm NOT irritable!' He rushed down
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-01.png	the stairs and, snatching the case, ran back
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-02.png	upstairs with it. 'And I've NOT been
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-03.png	extravagant.' &quot;Naughty!' she called
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-146/r02-146-04.png	after him. 'Mother knows her boy.

dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-02.png	poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-03.png	a buyer of property. No, not even an
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-04.png	infant-in-arms but a new-born babe, a
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-05.png	premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-06.png	tent of utter innocence. The complexity of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-07.png	that innocence was colossal. It had layer
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-08.png	after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-002/r03-002-09.png	replaced with sad knowledgeability.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-00.png	It was a nakedness of nai&quot;vety to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-01.png	clothed leaf by leaf with the disappointment
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-02.png	of experience. Her first illusion consisted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-03.png	the belief that all she need do was to go to
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-04.png	an agent, visit half a dozen houses in one
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-05.png	day, choose one, make an offer, put it in
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-06.png	the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-07.png	holiday while the whole transaction was
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-007/r03-007-08.png	put through.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-00.png	Fortunately, however, the fashion for Victorian
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-01.png	architecture which Mr. John Betjeman had
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-02.png	started several decades before had caught on
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-03.png	at last and therefore saved the situation for
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-04.png	the affluent middle-class, who now had plenty
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-05.png	of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant in. All this
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-06.png	Serena discovered, and more, but in stages. For the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-07.png	first thing she did was to make an offer
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-08.png	on a small pink terraced cottage, two beds,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-09.png	two inter-comm. rec., mod. k. and b., sep. W.C.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-026/r03-026-10.png	small back yard, newly dec., near shops and tube
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-00.png	The next thing that Serena discovered was that
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-01.png	she could not afford to buy a house at all.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-02.png	And this in spite of having at last managed
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-03.png	to save the ten percent needed. Or so she
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-04.png	thought, being then in possession of what
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-05.png	seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-030/r03-030-06.png	red pounds. The lawyer said:
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-00.png	&quot;Of course you must count about two hundred
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-01.png	for legal charges and stamp duties,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-02.png	maybe less, depending on the price of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-03.png	house, and whether it has been regis-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-04.png	tered. I take it you have a mortgage lined
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-05.png	up, then, Mrs. - er - Buttery?&quot; &quot;Not yet,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-06.png	but the bank would give me a loan, I'm
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-07.png	sure.&quot; &quot;Er, yes. You have some securities,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-035/r03-035-08.png	then?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-00.png	His aspect was as dusty as his office, with scurf
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-01.png	from dusty hair on the dusty shoulders of his black
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-02.png	suit, cigarette ash down the front, an ashen face
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-03.png	and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-04.png	grey eyes. His finger-nails were dirty, though he
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-05.png	tried to make up for it by constantly paring them
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-050/r03-050-06.png	with the finger-nail of the opposite hand.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-00.png	&quot;Yes, well....&quot; He judged that she had been sufficiently
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-01.png	dazzled and gave a long raucous cough. &quot;Only
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-02.png	cigarettes worth smoking, these. Most unhealthy, English
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-03.png	ones. Well, now, let me see. I think I can put you onto
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-04.png	some people who might, I say might, let you have a mortgage on
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-05.png	this property....&quot; &quot;But, they're safe, are they? I mean,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-06.png	they're not - money-lenders?&quot; &quot;Mrs. - er - Buttery,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-056/r03-056-07.png	all mortgage companies are money-lenders.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-00.png	That's rather the point, isn't it?&quot; &quot;No, but I mean -&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-01.png	&quot;I know what you mean. You may trust me, Mrs.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-02.png	Buttery. I think, however, that you might have
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-03.png	to revise your ideas about - er - the type of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-04.png	property you intend to purchase.&quot; She revised
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-05.png	them. The little man from the Inter-Insular
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-06.png	(British Archipelago) Insurance Company soon
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-065/r03-065-07.png	saw to that.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-00.png	I'm afraid we can't take yours into account
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-01.png	at all. It's a rule of I.I.I. You see, you
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-02.png	might stop work to have - well, for all sorts of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-03.png	reasons, or you might leave him." "But how
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-04.png	utterly extraordinary," said Serena angrily,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-05.png	"you must be living in the nineteenth century."
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-06.png	"Oh, but it's a very general rule, Mrs. Buttery,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-07.png	you'll find that no insurance companies,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-08.png	or building societies, for that matter, will
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-084/r03-084-09.png	allow for the wife's earnings.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-00.png	Our lawyers -&quot; &quot;Who are your lawyers?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-01.png	&quot;Clacton's.&quot; &quot;Well, I'm damned.&quot; &quot;Now, let me see,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-02.png	you say your husband earns about ... yes,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-03.png	that would come to ... three, carry seven, six
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-04.png	nines are fifty four - of course we'd have to
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-05.png	have some sort of proof, you know, it's very
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-090/r03-090-06.png	difficult with self-employed persons, carry two.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-00.png	&quot;You see,&quot; she propounded to Rupert after her last patient
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-01.png	had gone, &quot;we can get three thousand three fifty,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-02.png	perhaps a little more if we can cheat your earnings
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-03.png	a bit. I'm sure you could raise the rest from
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-04.png	one of your publishers, get two books commissioned
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-05.png	and write them later. I've got a bit owing too.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-06.png	Now, I saw some flats in Hendon for four thou,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-07.png	and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-08.png	two beds, two reception, k. and b., just think,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r03/r03-110/r03-110-09.png	our own bathroom.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-00.png	No, he hadn't read it; Madame did all the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-01.png	reading. Lawrence died in this very place.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-02.png	He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-03.png	again. No, he couldn't really remember
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-04.png	him, he was one of the crowd. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-05.png	sun came out; Mart went shopping; I
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-035/r06-035-06.png	sat in the square reading the Patriote.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-00.png	There was a front-page rear-attack on de
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-01.png	Gaulle, and the rest of the paper was given up
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-02.png	to murders, apart for an outcry against a
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-03.png	proposal to drop radio-active material into
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-04.png	the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-05.png	Raphael. All the murders were well documented
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-06.png	and had the air of being written by an
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-07.png	ingenious, but mad film director of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-041/r06-041-08.png	Thirties.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-00.png	They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-01.png	Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-02.png	throttled to death by his wife, children and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-03.png	father-in-law, after muddling up some sheep
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-04.png	while the worse for drink. The family
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-05.png	group then sat down for a late lunch
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-06.png	before the father-in-law telephoned the police.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-07.png	Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-08.png	troubles, had written to the local
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-09.png	paper and the superintendent of police,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-044/r06-044-10.png	informing them that he was on the point
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-00.png	Monsieur V's house was immediately
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-01.png	surrounded by firemen and other officials,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-02.png	but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-03.png	a few minutes later from a nearby village,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-04.png	apologising for the trouble, but explaining
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-05.png	that the walls were porous and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-06.png	gas had escaped. General relief was
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-07.png	expressed, but Monsieur V (this was
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-08.png	actually reported in the next issue) returned
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-09.png	home and shot himself, leaving a note
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-049/r06-049-10.png	which again left his household goods
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-00.png	Some grim comic relief was provided by
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-01.png	an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-02.png	who hid himself in a bush and imitated
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-03.png	a blackbird. Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-04.png	was after this very bird and shot the farm-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-05.png	labourer in the face. All, however,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-06.png	ended well, reported the paper, since the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-07.png	pellets were easily removed and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-08.png	labourer was able to return to work the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-053/r06-053-09.png	same afternoon.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-00.png	We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-01.png	You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-02.png	way. In the middle of the journey is a
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-03.png	valley with a sea of vines and olives
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-04.png	and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-05.png	the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-06.png	islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-07.png	towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-057/r06-057-08.png	like limpets to the rock.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-00.png	There is a curd of morning smoke and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-01.png	a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-02.png	stopped, as in fine weather we always
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-03.png	stopped. Down below is the village of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-04.png	Cagnes, but between are pockets of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-05.png	heat and cold like the hands of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-06.png	friends or strangers, and a flurry of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-07.png	early smells, the dark bosoms of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-08.png	beech and the thin pine fingers
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-062/r06-062-09.png	kissed by the sun.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-00.png	Then here was Nice, and the old holiday
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-01.png	sea, blue as a new school exercise
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-02.png	book. The same old Nice, creamy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-03.png	vulgar, out of time, bitter-sweet with
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-04.png	the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-05.png	prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-06.png	to the old sleeping port. This, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-07.png	Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-08.png	could catch the taste of dead dreams on
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-066/r06-066-09.png	my tongue like spray.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-00.png	We parked the Lambretta opposite the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-01.png	Negresco, and went to the beach to
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-02.png	have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-03.png	in our eyes. The sea boiled with waves,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-04.png	they galloped to the walls and spumed
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-05.png	over the Promenade des Anglais. A huge
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-06.png	crowd had collected. There were firemen
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-07.png	and policemen and ambulances, and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-08.png	eyes of the spectators were hard with
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-070/r06-070-09.png	disaster.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-00.png	They all had that neat look of
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-01.png	Mediterranean people to whom nothing
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-02.png	could ever happen, the chosen sane, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-03.png	uncuckolded, unrobbed, sheltered from
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-04.png	disease and accident by doctors, God and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-05.png	the municipality. Yet, at any time now,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-06.png	the bell would ring for them - the gilded
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-07.png	love house, the mad grandmother or the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-076/r06-076-08.png	bloody child at the crossroads.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-00.png	It was growing cold. We left the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-01.png	crowd and drove back to Vence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-02.png	The cool evening perfumes stood
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-03.png	beckoning at the corners of the roads.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-04.png	Mart is unable to smell (her sense
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-05.png	organs were impaired years ago), and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-06.png	I had to explain the low, sharp and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-07.png	sweet signals in the air. When we
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-08.png	got back home we felt exhausted.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-09.png	London sickness (a sense of guilt,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-090/r06-090-10.png	mingled with the memory of sandwiches
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-00.png	We went straight to bed and slept until
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-01.png	the turtle-doves drummed up the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-02.png	sun. The next morning, in the square
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-03.png	opposite Pierre's, I read about the Nice
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-04.png	beach catastrophe in the Patriote.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-05.png	Mart had been right, the body had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-06.png	a woman's. It belonged to a Madame
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-07.png	N. Enquiries had been made in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-08.png	neighbourhood, and it transpired that
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-09.png	Madame N's husband had made an
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-097/r06-097-10.png	arrangement with the dead lady's sister
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-00.png	The sister, able to swim, had returned
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-01.png	to the shore, but instead of returning
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-02.png	to her brother-in-law (with whom
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-03.png	she had an illicit relationship), she
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-04.png	went to her fiance*?2's house and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-05.png	confessed everything. Her fiance*?2
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-06.png	reported her to the police, and then jumped
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-103/r06-103-07.png	off a cliff near Monte Carlo.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-00.png	The day I promised to take Catherine
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-01.png	down to visit my young friend Philip
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-02.png	at his school in the country, we were
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-03.png	to leave at eleven, but she arrived
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-04.png	at nine. Her blue dress was new,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-05.png	and so were her fashionable shoes. Her
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-06.png	hair had just been done. She looked
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-07.png	more than ever like a pink and gold
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-08.png	Renoir girl who expects everything from
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-106/r06-106-09.png	life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-00.png	Catherine lives in a white house
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-01.png	overlooking the sweeping brown tides
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-02.png	of the river. She helped me clean up my
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-03.png	flat with a devotion which said that
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-04.png	she felt small flats were altogether more
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-05.png	romantic than large houses. We drank
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-06.png	tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-07.png	being 15, has pure stern tastes in every-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-111/r06-111-08.png	thing from food to music.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-00.png	Catherine looked at the books lying
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-01.png	around his room, and asked if she
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-02.png	might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-03.png	to read on the train. Catherine is 13.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-04.png	I suggested she might find them dif-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-05.png	ficult, but she said, 'Philip reads them,
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-06.png	doesn't he?' During the journey I read
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-07.png	newspapers and watched her pretty
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-08.png	frowning face as she turned the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-09.png	pages of Babel, for she was determined
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-115/r06-115-10.png	to let nothing get between her and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-00.png	At the school, which is charming, ci-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-01.png	vilised and expensive, the two children
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-02.png	walked together across green fields, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-03.png	I followed, seeing how the sun gilded
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-04.png	their bright friendly heads turned
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-05.png	towards each other as they talked. In
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-06.png	Catherine's left hand she carried the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-07.png	stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-08.png	went to the pictures. Philip allowed
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-09.png	# it to be seen that he thought going to
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-121/r06-121-10.png	the pictures just for the fun of it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-00.png	For his sake we chose the more
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-01.png	serious of the two films that were
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-02.png	showing in the little town. It was
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-03.png	about a good priest who helped cri-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-04.png	minals in New York. His goodness, how-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-05.png	ever, was not enough to prevent one
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-06.png	of them from being sent to the gas
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-07.png	chamber; and Philip and I waited with
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-08.png	Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-09.png	crying and could face the light of a golden
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-126/r06-126-10.png	evening.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-00.png	At the entrance of the cinema the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-01.png	doorman was lying in wait for anyone
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-02.png	who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-03.png	by her suffering arm, he said bitterly:
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-04.png	'Yes, why are you crying, he had to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-05.png	punished for his crime, didn't he?' Cathe-
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-06.png	rine stared at him, incredulous. Philip
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-07.png	rescued her by saying with disdain:
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-08.png	'Some people don't know right from wrong
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-130/r06-130-09.png	even when its demonstrated to them.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-00.png	The doorman turned his attention
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-01.png	to the next red-eyed emerger from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-02.png	dark; and we went on together to
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-03.png	the station, the children silent because
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-04.png	of the cruelty of the world. Finally Catherine
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-05.png	said, her eyes wet again: 'I think its all
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-06.png	absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-07.png	about it.' And Philip said: 'But we've got
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-08.png	to think about it, don't you see, because
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-09.png	if we don't it'll just go on and on, don't
dataset/iam_lines/data/r06/r06-137/r06-137-10.png	you see?'
