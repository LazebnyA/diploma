dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-014x/a01-014x-02.png	future. Said Mr. Nkumbula last night:
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-014x/a01-014x-03.png	&quot;We want to discuss what to do if the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-014x/a01-014x-04.png	British Government gives in to Sir Roy
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-014x/a01-014x-05.png	and the talks fall through. There are bound

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026x/a01-026x-06.png	and the Dominion Party. But representatives

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026x/a01-026x-08.png	Central African Federation, went to Chequers
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-026x/a01-026x-09.png	at the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-00.png	Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-01.png	Lancaster House despite the crisis which had
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-02.png	blown up. He has now revealed his full plans
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-03.png	to the Africans and Liberals attending. These
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-04.png	plans do not give the Africans the overall
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-05.png	majority they are seeking. African delegates
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-06.png	are studying them today. The conference
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-07.png	will meet to discuss the function of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-020/a01-020-08.png	proposed House of Chiefs.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-01.png	resume today. President Kennedy today
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-02.png	defended the appointment of a Negro as
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-03.png	his Housing Minister. It has aroused
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-04.png	strong opposition from the anti-Negro
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-05.png	senators of the Deep South. The negro
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-06.png	is Mr. Robert Weaver of New York. One
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-07.png	of his tasks will be to see there is no
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-08.png	racial discrimination in Government
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-043/a01-043-09.png	and State housing projects.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-03.png	that Weaver once had Communist affiliations.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-04.png	The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-05.png	by another Southern Senator - Willis Robertson,
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-06.png	of Virginia - met today in closed session
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-07.png	to discuss Weaver's appointment. Senator
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-08.png	Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-09.png	to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-049/a01-049-10.png	complaints about Weaver's loyalty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-00.png	&quot;That cannot continue without either
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-01.png	development being limited or an
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-02.png	adjustment being made in financing.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-03.png	The Government decided to adjust

dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-05.png	claimed was underpinning - not
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-06.png	undermining - the service. Answering the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-07.png	attack on &quot;economic charges&quot; for welfare
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-08.png	foods, Mr. Powell said that all these
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-09.png	foods would still be free in families
dataset/iam_lines/data/a01/a01-132/a01-132-10.png	receiving regular National Assistance

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-00.png	All four were Conservative strongholds. Last September
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-01.png	a public poll showed that for the first time since
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-02.png	the Administration came to power in 1957 the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-03.png	Liberals were ahead (43 per cent were in favour

dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-05.png	held last autumn, 38 per cent for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-040/a03-040-06.png	Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F.).
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-00.png	Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-01.png	remove these doubts, and to persuade the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-02.png	Federal Government that the financial burden
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-03.png	involved is really worth while, at a time when
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-04.png	any increase in budgetary commitments
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-05.png	would almost certainly involve a corresponding
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-06.png	rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
dataset/iam_lines/data/a03/a03-066/a03-066-07.png	to contemplate in an election year.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-04.png	good beginning made at Vienna must be
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-031/a04-031-05.png	followed up by new efforts for peace, the

dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-035/a04-035-07.png	arrived from Vienna. A cheering, delighted crowd

dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-01.png	defence of the Polaris missile base. And by
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-02.png	implication he supported the establishment of

dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-04.png	troops. His main theme was that nuclear
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-05.png	weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-06.png	Britain must depend on Nato and &quot;the West&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-07.png	must have nuclear weapons so long as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/a04/a04-043/a04-043-08.png	Soviet Union has them.

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-014/a06-014-10.png	invitation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-00.png	The other TUC demands: Five leading

dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-04.png	disband in ten days. These the ETU
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-05.png	executive rejected as &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-06.png	and &quot;unwarranted&quot; interference.&quot; But it
dataset/iam_lines/data/a06/a06-025/a06-025-07.png	agreed to postpone operation of the sub-

dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-00.png	The first reaction of the Sudanese
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-01.png	Government was to denounce the United
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-02.png	Nations for &quot;negligence and impotence,&quot; and
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-03.png	to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-04.png	would be taken home. The reaction can be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-05.png	understood. The Sudan's concern for its
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-06.png	men is natural. But this could hardly be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-07.png	a # dignified exit. IF the UN is
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-08.png	blamed for being weak, it would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-09.png	more logical to send in more men,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-073/b01-073-10.png	not weaken it further by desertion.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-00.png	It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-01.png	Hammarskjold and the UN's servants. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-02.png	responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-03.png	which have undertaken the task of pre-
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-04.png	serving peace in the Congo. That is not a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-05.png	ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-06.png	right to blame the politicians unless they see
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-07.png	it through. When the United Nations instructed
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-08.png	Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-09.png	prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers
dataset/iam_lines/data/b01/b01-079/b01-079-10.png	would arise unless it gave him the political ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-00.png	Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-01.png	this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June, made it
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-02.png	very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-03.png	principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-04.png	that the Government should ever have been led away
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-05.png	from this principle. It is a great pity that the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-06.png	Government should give the appearance of responding, not
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-07.png	to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations, but to
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-045/b02-045-08.png	the violence which he tried to prevent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b02/b02-102/b02-102-00.png	To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-04.png	pattern of British Government connivance became
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-05.png	clear. At nazi Germany's request, Britain was
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-06.png	providing the cloak for Germany to build an
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-004/b06-004-07.png	air force bigger than that of France.

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-02.png	the alternatives had been put clearly to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-03.png	movement, which had then chosen a vigorous
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-04.png	anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-05.png	rearmament policy. Hopes rose as we saw a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-06.png	perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-07.png	lines of difference with the Tories. Many members
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-08.png	understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-049/b06-049-09.png	of the union would become easier in the context
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-00.png	At the same time that unity cannot be
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-01.png	established on a false basis, or by creating
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-02.png	further confusion within the movement. Unity
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-03.png	will never be established on the basis of leaders
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-04.png	being a law unto themselves and opposing
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-05.png	conference decisions when it suits their own
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-06.png	convenience. Unity can never be established by
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-07.png	any formula uniting those who oppose German
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-08.png	troops being trained on British soil and Polaris,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-09.png	and those who are for this policy - which is the
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-075/b06-075-10.png	same as that of the Tory Government.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-00.png	This sort of situation calls for some subtle,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-01.png	slightly sardonic handling. It doesn't get it. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-02.png	The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c06/c06-111/c06-111-03.png	time. I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-01.png	will back West Germany's economic domination of Western
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-02.png	Europe through the Common Market. He continued this week
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-03.png	the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-04.png	Nato council meeting last year over the question: do we
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-012/b06-012-05.png	fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war?
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-00.png	Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-01.png	and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-02.png	control. Nato, far from being a means of controlling
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-03.png	the German militarists, is, in fact, the cover for
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-04.png	building up their power. What must Britain do? Today,
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-05.png	again, she has a key role. Let her tell men like Strauss
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-06.png	that he shall have no bases or &quot;facilities,&quot; no help in
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-036/b06-036-07.png	his quest for atomic arms.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-00.png	But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-01.png	prefer unskilled jobs. Countless numbers who want training
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-02.png	are denied it. One area electricity board in 1958
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-03.png	offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-04.png	applications, of whom 100 were considered suitable by
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-110/b06-110-05.png	the board. There were only 17 vacancies for the 58

dataset/iam_lines/data/c06/c06-043/c06-043-04.png	heralded by the announcement that

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-04.png	trade unionists, when it decided by overwhelming
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-05.png	votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-06.png	on unilateral disarmament, and to oppose

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-087/b06-087-08.png	the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-00.png	Such a policy would unite the whole movement
dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-01.png	and lay the basis for the defeat of the

dataset/iam_lines/data/b06/b06-090/b06-090-05.png	that the movement will go on record against

dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-000/c02-000-09.png	can be counted on the fingers of one
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-00.png	This director is at last being re-evaluated and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-01.png	given his proper place in the history of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-02.png	German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-03.png	&quot;Unheimliche Geschichten&quot; (1920), five ghost stories
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-04.png	with a light touch, and there was much to admire
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-05.png	in &quot;Dreyfus&quot; (1930) and the virtually unknown
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-06.png	but extremely important &quot;1914&quot; (1931), which
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-07.png	tries to show that it took more than just
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-056/c02-056-08.png	Germany to start the First World War.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-00.png	It has a great look of speed and technical fun
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-01.png	about it, of enormous cinematic enjoyment, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-02.png	above all of cinematic sense. Much of it has
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-03.png	that air of improvisation, as of off-the-cuff
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-04.png	living, that once seemed so new and so
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-05.png	attractive. The story (not that the story, in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-06.png	sense of plot, matters much; but in the sense of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-07.png	situation and movement it matters a lot) is
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-08.png	that of a man on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo),
dataset/iam_lines/data/c02/c02-078/c02-078-09.png	who spends a few days with an American girl
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000d/c03-000d-00.png	The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000d/c03-000d-02.png	Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been pro-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000d/c03-000d-03.png	duced and directed by Mr. Tony Richardson,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000d/c03-000d-04.png	who is also part-author with Miss Delaney
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000d/c03-000d-05.png	of the script, and the great advantages to

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-000d/c03-000d-07.png	control are everywhere apparent.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-00.png	This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-01.png	throughout in terms of the cinema, and again
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-02.png	and again it is the visual qualities of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-03.png	story, and the marriage of the central charac-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-04.png	ters to their background, which bring the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-05.png	film so vividly to life. In Fanny, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-06.png	also has its premiere tomorrow, the director,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-07.png	Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-003d/c03-003d-08.png	create the atmosphere of a city.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-00.png	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-01.png	taken a town in the industrial North of
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-02.png	England and has made it live. The shabby
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-03.png	streets and wet pavements, the school
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-04.png	play-grounds, the public monuments and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-05.png	the rubbish strewn canals - even the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-06.png	worn head-stones in the churchyard, &quot;sacred
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-07.png	to the memory of&quot; - are seen as an
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-007d/c03-007d-08.png	integral part of the story.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-01.png	intense realism in the situation. A young
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-02.png	girl lives in a single dingy room with
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-03.png	her slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-04.png	surroundings she learns sex is something
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-05.png	sordid, and when she experiences it for
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-06.png	the first time herself it is incoherently, clumsily,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-07.png	but half shyly and half inquisitively. As
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-08.png	is the case in Fanny her first lover is a sailor
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-09.png	who leaves her to bear his child and sails
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016d/c03-016d-10.png	away.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-00.png	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-01.png	an old man. Here it is a young homosexual,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-02.png	estranged from women but yet moved by a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-03.png	strong maternal instinct to the unborn child
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-04.png	as much as to the expectant mother, who
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-05.png	acts as a protector and comforter to her in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-06.png	her hour of need. He shares her room and gives
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-07.png	her his forlorn gift of companionship and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-08.png	sympathy - &quot;you need someone to love you while
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-021d/c03-021d-09.png	you are looking for someone to love&quot;.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-00.png	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-01.png	technical error in allowing Irene to speak
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-02.png	for herself; we would be altogether clearer
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-03.png	in our minds about her if she remained
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-04.png	a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-05.png	not heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-06.png	makes her few brief scenes effective, and Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-07.png	Dinsdale Landen, in the longest and most
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-08.png	exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-09.png	a performance of rare intelligence and
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-081d/c03-081d-10.png	restrained power.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-00.png	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-01.png	effective, giving full value to the formal
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-02.png	elements of Betti's writing without over-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-03.png	emphasizing them. Last night's play in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-04.png	&quot;Play of the Week&quot; series on independent
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-05.png	television, Then We Fall, by Mr. Paul Fer-
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-06.png	ris, was a morality on the not unfamiliar
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-07.png	theme of the destructive power of unbridled
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-084d/c03-084d-08.png	ambition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-00.png	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-01.png	most treatments of its subject by
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-02.png	attempting to generate a melodramatic
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-03.png	inevitability which left its central character
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-04.png	and the world around him in complete,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-05.png	unredeemable desolation. We could, perhaps,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-06.png	say whether or not the attempt succeeded
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-07.png	of we had a little more faith in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-08.png	way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-087d/c03-087d-09.png	his characters.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094d/c03-094d-00.png	Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094d/c03-094d-06.png	comically grotesque; they were not
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094d/c03-094d-07.png	asked to modulate from their set moods
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094d/c03-094d-08.png	but played with proper efficiency and,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094d/c03-094d-09.png	in the case of Mr. Richards, with lavish
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094d/c03-094d-10.png	and suitably gaudy colour.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096d/c03-096d-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096d/c03-096d-01.png	explicably from appreciable motives. The

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-00.png	But there is heart in the telling, and an
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-01.png	intense realism in the situation. A young
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-02.png	girl lives in a single dingy room with her
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-03.png	slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-08.png	quisitively. As is the case in Fanny her
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-09.png	first lover is a sailor who leaves her to
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-016e/c03-016e-10.png	bear his child and sails away.

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096e/c03-096e-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose

dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094f/c03-094f-08.png	efficiency and, in the case of Mr. Richards,
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-094f/c03-094f-09.png	with lavish and suitably gaudy colour.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-00.png	Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-01.png	explicably from appreciable motives. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-02.png	rest, one feels, were driven to effective
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-03.png	action by the author in spite of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-04.png	ineffectuality with which he had endowed
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-05.png	them. One hopes that he is not asking us
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-06.png	to believe that, because of their odd
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-07.png	accents, they act oddly like the queer
dataset/iam_lines/data/c03/c03-096f/c03-096f-08.png	foreigners of tradition.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-00.png	NEXT month that friendly, effervescent performer Frankie
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-01.png	Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-02.png	in a new show. To paraphrase his well-known ditty:
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-03.png	&quot;He'll have the limelight, they'll give him the girls -
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-000/c04-000-04.png	and leave the rest to him.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-00.png	I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-01.png	old, star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-02.png	Hollywood. His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-03.png	recently given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-04.png	treatment. But they haven't done a thing for his film
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-05.png	career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-06.png	doing better here, before the platinum-plated Hollywood
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-004/c04-004-07.png	carrot was dangled before his nose.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-00.png	He has earned his break. The film is a well-made
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-01.png	variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-02.png	try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-03.png	Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-04.png	built up neatly. Susan Strasberg is the crippled
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-023/c04-023-05.png	damsel in distress.
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-00.png	Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-01.png	also effectively around. They provide some chilly red
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-02.png	herrings in this &quot;Find-the-body&quot; thriller. VERDICT:
dataset/iam_lines/data/c04/c04-028/c04-028-03.png	Don't believe all you see and hear!

dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-00.png	The most convenient one for the authors
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-01.png	has been the text of A. Souter. In this
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-02.png	version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-03.png	printed as just over 1,000 different nouns,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-04.png	verbs, and other parts of speech occurring
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-05.png	15,695 times in their different grammatical
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-06.png	forms. There are other texts which could
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-07.png	have been used, and (as shown in Table 1)
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-08.png	it is not a matter of the greatest importance
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-056/d01-056-09.png	which text is used.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-00.png	At first sight the difference between
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-01.png	Souter and the other texts is rather
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-02.png	large. But the British text includes
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-03.png	the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-04.png	taken in Adultery, and this accounts
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-05.png	for 178 words out of 279, which is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-06.png	the difference between the 15,695 words
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-07.png	of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-08.png	The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-060/d01-060-09.png	is a matter of editorial decision rather
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-00.png	The bar was the commonest marking, but others
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-01.png	were also used. Dots sometimes served in place of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-02.png	bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-03.png	it is now used to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-04.png	paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H. Roberts is of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-05.png	the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-06.png	some markings would be used, although which, it is
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-080/d01-080-07.png	impossible to say.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-00.png	Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-01.png	the original of the Gospel would be unmarked. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-02.png	original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-03.png	whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-04.png	columns. This is the invariable practice of ancient
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-05.png	manuscripts. A common size of column would hold
dataset/iam_lines/data/d01/d01-085/d01-085-06.png	about one third of a page of Souter's print.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-00.png	Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-01.png	by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-02.png	that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-03.png	but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-04.png	that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-05.png	to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-003/d06-003-06.png	other side as victors.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-00.png	Can we then frame some 'rules' which may enable us to live life
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-01.png	as fully as possible, without having our energy sapped by un-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-02.png	necessary weariness. (a) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-03.png	We have a saying 'My head will never save my feet'. Time
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-04.png	after time we forget something and have to go back
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-076/d06-076-05.png	upstairs or down to the shops.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-00.png	I would not want to either, but if she wants to get through
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-01.png	the day without becoming exhausted, she will be well advised to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-02.png	sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-03.png	do, note the order in which they can most conveniently be
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-04.png	done (or must be done because of other predetermined factors
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-05.png	- you must, for example, do your shopping on the morning of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-111/d06-111-06.png	the early closing day).
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-00.png	In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-01.png	Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-02.png	they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-03.png	in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-04.png	echo-sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-05.png	their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-06.png	gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-010/e06-010-07.png	spawning herring are always found.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-00.png	(Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-01.png	be by actual contact, or by sight reaction to the disturbed
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-02.png	sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-03.png	through or along the bottom.) But given such a bow
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-04.png	wave of disturbance, it is obvious that without something
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-046/e06-046-05.png	to overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-00.png	Because situations which may contain
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-01.png	all the elements of fear can arise suddenly,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-02.png	it is a good idea to condition a child
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-03.png	to some extent against it. To keep a child
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-04.png	of twelve or thirteen under the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-05.png	impression that nothing nasty ever
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-06.png	happens is not merely dishonest, it
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-07.png	is unwise. As I shall suggest in a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-08.png	later chapter there are some situations
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-011/d06-011-09.png	which occur less frequently than
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-00.png	It was a little complicated to work,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-01.png	of course, and there had to be a big
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-02.png	notice in the entrance saying which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-03.png	day of the timetable it was - but
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-04.png	it added immensely to the interest
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-05.png	and kept everybody on their toes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-06.png	To have order does not mean getting
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-07.png	into a dull routine. I have great
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-08.png	sympathy with the young wife
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-09.png	who does not always want to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/d06/d06-107/d06-107-10.png	the washing on a Monday.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-00.png	Thus we can see that herring
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-01.png	movements, although primarily
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-02.png	instinctive perhaps, and certainly
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-03.png	helped and hindered by water flow,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-04.png	are also closely related to the sea-bed
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-05.png	geography. Geography, too, names the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-06.png	great fisheries that depend on them:
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-07.png	the Fladen Ground (where again most big
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-08.png	shots are taken on the edges), the Gut,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-09.png	a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-003/e06-003-10.png	the herring spawn along the northern
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-00.png	The joint evidence of echo-sounders
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-01.png	and fishing gear leads to an overall
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-02.png	though somewhat dim picture.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-03.png	The details are harder still to see.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-04.png	Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-05.png	shoals that gather at the Knoll or
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-06.png	other banks are most of them
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-07.png	going to travel a hundred
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-08.png	miles farther south before they
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-015/e06-015-09.png	spawn. Some will spawn at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-00.png	Easterly winds, on the other hand,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-01.png	mean no herring along the shore, as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-02.png	recent years have shown. A succession
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-03.png	of winds is needed for this effect of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-04.png	course - one breeze will not do it,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-05.png	though a very hard westerly will
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-06.png	often start off the "local" herring;
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-07.png	but quite apart from this wind effect
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-08.png	there is an easterly drift special
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-09.png	to this rump of coastline, caused by
dataset/iam_lines/data/e06/e06-030/e06-030-10.png	the meeting of water from north and south.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-00.png	(Actually, the Mishnah quotes two further proof
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-01.png	texts and the Gemara explains why these,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-02.png	too, are necessary, but a careful examination
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-03.png	of that passage makes it clear that these are
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-04.png	not quoted here because they are not
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-05.png	necessary to prove the point made by
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-06.png	R. Joshua b. Levi.) Finally, we note that
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-07.png	the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-082/d07-082-08.png	elsewhere.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-00.png	From the above it follows that here, once again,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-01.png	we have a good illustration of how a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-02.png	sugya has been fashioned from material
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-03.png	already in the hands of the Redactors.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-04.png	The sugya is built around the saying of
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-05.png	R. Joshua b. Levi. The proof text for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-06.png	reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-085/d07-085-07.png	with the comment given by Samuel.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-00.png	(This is probably to be understood as a well-
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-01.png	known comment on the verse; quoted by
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-02.png	Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-03.png	by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-04.png	Levi's thesis!) The proof text of greeting by
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-05.png	the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-06.png	There is no reference to the Mishnah here
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-07.png	because the Mishnah deals with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-08.png	actual practice of greeting by the divine
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-09.png	Name and the Gemara here quotes the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-089/d07-089-10.png	texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-00.png	The question and answer with regard to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-01.png	need for the text of the angel are quoted
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-02.png	here in the same words in which they are
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-03.png	quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-04.png	This can either mean that both sugyas are
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-05.png	quoting a well-known question and
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-06.png	answer or that our sugya is quoting from
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-07.png	the longer sugya which deals with all
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-093/d07-093-08.png	four texts quoted in the Mishnah.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-00.png	Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-01.png	original question and answer and this is quoted
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-02.png	in the other sugya. (This can be supported by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-03.png	use of the expression: 'Boaz did it of his own
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-04.png	accord but there was no approval of his action
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-05.png	in Heaven' in both sugyoth. Such an
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-06.png	expression appears to have been framed in
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-07.png	response to the particular point at issue here,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-08.png	whether the Heavenly Court concurred
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-096/d07-096-09.png	in the decision of the human court.)
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-00.png	The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-01.png	is then quoted and the interpretation of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-02.png	latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-03.png	is added, not because this is at all relevant
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-04.png	to the discussion but because it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-05.png	a familiar interpretation which had
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-06.png	become so well known that it was
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-07.png	invariably quoted whenever the verse
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-08.png	itself was quoted, almost as if it were a
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-100/d07-100-09.png	part of the verse.
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-00.png	The Gemara continues with a saying of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-01.png	Palestinian teacher, R. Eleazar (3rd Cent.):
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-02.png	'The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places:
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-03.png	the court of Shem, the court of Samuel of Ramah,
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-04.png	and the court of Solomon.' The place of this
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-05.png	saying here is obvious, it follows naturally
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-06.png	on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
dataset/iam_lines/data/d07/d07-102/d07-102-07.png	deals with a similar theme.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-00.png	We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-01.png	that he was a great man for lace - paying
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-02.png	as much as 3 for a lace collar. But this
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-03.png	didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-04.png	for his lady, for he records testily: 'My wife
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-05.png	and I fell out about my not being willing
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-014/e01-014-06.png	to have her gown laced.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-00.png	We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-01.png	reign of Charles 2 stating: 'Lost: a lawn 1hand-
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-02.png	kercher with a broad hem laced round with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-03.png	fine Point lace about four fingers broad' and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-04.png	among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-05.png	unpaid bill for 'scarlet satin shoes with
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-06.png	silver lace'. The records of these tender trifles
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-07.png	are very touching but then lace does place
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-018/e01-018-08.png	upon everything a delicate sentiment.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-00.png	First launder crochet and then pin to the required
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-01.png	shape, ensuring that all lines of the crochet are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-02.png	accurate. Place crochet in correct position on linen and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-03.png	secure with pins. Run a line of basting stitches
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-04.png	on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-081/e01-081-05.png	which are to be attached to the linen. Remove crochet.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-00.png	Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen:
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-01.png	(a) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-02.png	the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-03.png	outside edge. Oversew crochet to button stitch.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-04.png	(b) Turn under a small hem, with fold lying on line
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-05.png	of basting stitches. Work a row of dc all round
dataset/iam_lines/data/e01/e01-086/e01-086-06.png	this hem, with 3 dc at each corner.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-00.png	A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-01.png	legs, and in reproduction period pieces they
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-02.png	are frequently used. The simpler varieties are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-03.png	extremely easy to work, the four sides being
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-04.png	simply planed to give the required taper. In
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-05.png	the more elaborate varieties, however, a toe is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-06.png	worked in the solid, and this certainly
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-000/e02-000-07.png	complicates the operation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-00.png	Incidentally, it is better to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-01.png	complete any mortising that may be
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-02.png	needed at the top before the tapering is
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-03.png	begun. Some plain tapered legs have
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-04.png	the taper on the two inner faces only,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-05.png	the outer surfaces being vertical as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-06.png	at (B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-07.png	that at (D), Fig. 1, the square is first
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-021/e02-021-08.png	marked out as at (A), Fig. 3.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-00.png	As a still further development, we follow
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-01.png	with a good basic kit, which includes
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-02.png	the fuller kit (which in its turn, of course,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-03.png	includes the bare minimum kit).
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-04.png	With this the vast majority of jobs
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-05.png	can be done, though for advanced
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-06.png	cabinet work the necessity for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-07.png	certain special tools will become
dataset/iam_lines/data/e02/e02-091/e02-091-08.png	obvious.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-00.png	The amount of the backward tilt and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-01.png	also the height is left to personal choice
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-02.png	and the width is best taken directly
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-03.png	from the work to ensure a good fit.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-04.png	Fix the piece A to the sides first
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-05.png	with glue and panel pins and then fit
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-06.png	the frame together with the piece
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-07.png	B temporarily in place on the chair
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-019/e04-019-08.png	frame.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-00.png	Decide on the required angle of slope,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-01.png	keeping B flat on the chair seat, and mark
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-02.png	off the exact position of B on the side
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-03.png	pieces. These can then be cut at the correct
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-04.png	angle and B is glued and nailed in place.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-05.png	A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-06.png	to the frame and its edges planed off
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-022/e04-022-07.png	flush.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-00.png	If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-01.png	the moulds, make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-02.png	Fig. 2. The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-03.png	rigid as possible, for it is on these you will be building
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-04.png	and shaping your little craft, upside-down. For cheapness
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-05.png	I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-058/e04-058-06.png	Columbia.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-00.png	This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-01.png	a permanently water proof glue line. Be sure to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-02.png	see that the edge bears the mark, P.M.B.C. Exterior.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-03.png	This may be bought at any good timber merchants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-04.png	The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-05.png	wood of the same make, or oak or mahogany. For the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-06.png	last one I made, I used the two flaps from an old
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-07.png	mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-062/e04-062-08.png	shilling.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-00.png	I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-01.png	rowing this dinghy (Fig. 3). They are very simple, cheap
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-02.png	and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-03.png	there is only a single gunwale on the outside.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-04.png	I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-05.png	is difficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome
dataset/iam_lines/data/e04/e04-068/e04-068-06.png	this in another way as shown in Fig. 4.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-00.png	The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-01.png	brittle nature; even with reasonably careful
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-02.png	handling, the annual losses are often around
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-03.png	10 per cent., and where the handling and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-04.png	storage facilities are not too good, these
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-05.png	losses will be even greater. This does not
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-06.png	necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-07.png	they are not quite so fragile as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-08.png	smaller ones and are not normally thrown
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-076/e07-076-09.png	about in quite the same way.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-00.png	The storage problem puts clay pots at a
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-01.png	definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-02.png	and difficult things to accommodate and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-03.png	they must have some protection from severe
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-04.png	weather, which can be quite a headache in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-05.png	a small garden. While admitting that
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-06.png	broken pots have on occasions provided
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-07.png	artists with delightful studies, there is no
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-08.png	doubt that a pile of badly stacked,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-09.png	half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-079/e07-079-10.png	from any point of view.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-00.png	Every garden boy will agree that having to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-01.png	wash clay pots is a definite factor in
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-02.png	favour of their abolition; in fact one
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-03.png	young man was so wholehearted about this
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-04.png	a few years ago that he made the headlines
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-05.png	for having smashed a large number # to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-06.png	relieve his feelings. On the small-to-medium
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-07.png	establishment, it is a disagreeable chore
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-08.png	which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm,
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-09.png	whereas on larger establishments the pots
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-083/e07-083-10.png	can be sterilized or washed by machine.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-00.png	It is not easy to make an economic
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-01.png	comparison between clay pots and the various
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-02.png	substitutes; the former may last indefinitely
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-03.png	with luck, while the latter are often
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-04.png	expendable used only once. Clay pots are
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-05.png	efficient and congenial containers in which
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-06.png	to grow plants. In their proper setting they
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-07.png	are not unattractive and, in spite of
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-08.png	their shortcomings, most gardeners have
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-086/e07-086-09.png	a nostalgic affection for them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-00.png	Present-day pots are better finished, do
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-01.png	not get dirty so readily and are easier to
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-02.png	wash. The deep rims make for neater and
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-03.png	safer stacking, though they are still
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-04.png	expensive and still get broken. On the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-05.png	other hand, there is really no replacement
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-06.png	for the larger sizes, so they have the
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-07.png	decided advantage of being the only
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-08.png	suitable container available in quantity
dataset/iam_lines/data/e07/e07-090/e07-090-09.png	for fairly large plants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-00.png	A small panel was formed, not on a formally representative
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-01.png	basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-02.png	from various levels in the firm. In due course
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-03.png	the panel decided to seek further insight into the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-04.png	problems faced by older workers, and approached
dataset/iam_lines/data/f02/f02-003/f02-003-05.png	those seventy years of age or older.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-00.png	But both purse and ticket, and the packages, were gone when the body
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-01.png	was found at Waterloo. Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-02.png	likely that she had been carrying much money. A porter at Hounslow
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-03.png	supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-04.png	compartment when the train left, but this did not help much, since it
dataset/iam_lines/data/f04/f04-020/f04-020-05.png	had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-00.png	It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-01.png	in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play. The place and its people were
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-02.png	to play an important part in my life. For five years in succession till
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-03.png	war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays there and became
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-04.png	very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-05.png	Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-06.png	performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-017/g04-017-07.png	be discovered and trained.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-00.png	First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-01.png	any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-02.png	old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-03.png	and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-04.png	teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-05.png	the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-026/g04-026-06.png	could render simple part-singing tolerably well.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-00.png	Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's 'Hiawatha's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-01.png	Wedding Feast.' Enthusiasm grew, and in a few more months we
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-02.png	gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-03.png	and the tenor solo 'Onaway awake' was sung by the Rector.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-04.png	Friends from Limpsfield, in addition to the villagers, came up,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-032/g04-032-05.png	and we were all happy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-00.png	For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-01.png	in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-02.png	four or more children, compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-03.png	and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957. As with the price of energy index,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-04.png	the only noteworthy change was for households with three children,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-05.png	in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-025/h04-025-06.png	all households in the sample.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-00.png	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-01.png	told us that there was nothing an En-

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-04.png	Italian would not sing; no music
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-05.png	to which the Frenchman would not
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-06.png	dance; nothing the German would
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-07.png	not covet; and nothing the Chinese
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-000/f07-000-08.png	would not eat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-00.png	According to Pliny, and others, certain herbs
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-01.png	and flowers proved of sovereign power
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-02.png	clarifying the functions of the brain. It
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-03.png	is said that there is nothing new under
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-04.png	the sun, but regarding foodstuffs the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-05.png	traveller occasionally encounters a certain
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-039a/f07-039a-06.png	measure of novelty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-00.png	In China, for instance, dried rats are esteemed
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-01.png	a delicacy. The visitor is told that
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-02.png	they restore the hair of the bald and that
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-03.png	a stewed black rat will ward off a fever.
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-04.png	A number of newly-born white mice served

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-06.png	like a prairie oyster is considered a
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-042a/f07-042a-07.png	piece of resistance.

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-02.png	definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-03.png	peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-04.png	as an article of diet. So have the Japanese
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-05.png	and the Chinese. The Celestials, apart
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-06.png	from eating it fresh, squash it, press
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-07.png	it and dry it, in which form, dusted
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-08.png	over with flour, you will find a stack
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-046a/f07-046a-09.png	of it in almost any provision shop.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-00.png	Their friendship for Augusta became rather
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-01.png	hollow, and the news that Byron had left
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-02.png	her practically all his money caused it to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-03.png	crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-04.png	knew perfectly well that Byron, as early
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-05.png	as the year of their wedding, 1815, had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-06.png	made a will in Augusta's favour, she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-07.png	evidently not passed on that information;
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-08.png	and it came as an appalling surprise to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-09.png	Captain Byron that he had been left
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-10.png	without the fortune that would keep up the

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-05.png	It is a far enough cry from the primitive
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-06.png	meal-times of a simpler world to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-013/f07-013-07.png	banquets of later days, when the table

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-01.png	in those Roman feasts, for instance, with
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-02.png	all their peacocks and nightingales'
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-03.png	tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-04.png	elaborate fashion of eating brought
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-05.png	out of Italy into France, we are told,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-06.png	by Catherine de Medici. The peasant in
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-07.png	those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-08.png	generously enough in his own fashion,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-09.png	save at feast times, when he, too, let
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-016/f07-016-10.png	himself go; and it was from his simpler
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-00.png	Epicures and gourmands, sated by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-01.png	unending procession of dishes from those
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-02.png	mammoth kitchens of the 18th century -
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-03.png	that amazing epoch of grossness and
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-04.png	delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-05.png	the dishes of the country, and, instead
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-06.png	of gorging the eye with magnitude,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-07.png	began to understand the value of
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-019b/f07-019b-08.png	intelligent selection and comparative

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-01.png	of boiling water and food? The ancient
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-02.png	Britons, I believe, used to make water hot
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-03.png	by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-04.png	because their pots would not stand fire;
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-05.png	but Jacob must have had one that
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-06.png	would, because Esau sold his birthright
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-07.png	to him for a mess of pottage - and then
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-021b/f07-021b-08.png	we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-04.png	dish was a grill, which he cooked himself,
dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-05.png	and he knew how to do it, too: - When the

dataset/iam_lines/data/f07/f07-024b/f07-024b-07.png	throws a bed of glowing embers wide;

dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-04.png	Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-05.png	comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-012/g01-012-06.png	citizen.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-00.png	These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-01.png	obvious morals for those who are judges long
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-02.png	after the event. It seems obvious that, though
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-03.png	the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-04.png	plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-05.png	battle was no substitute for a sound policy,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-06.png	and that, if archers had no target, campaigns
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-016/g01-016-07.png	became mere marauding route marches.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-00.png	It seems obvious that if an expedition to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-01.png	Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-02.png	then the primary essential to the success
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-03.png	of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-04.png	command of the Channel. It seems obvious
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-05.png	that divided forces were dissipating the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-06.png	advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-07.png	Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bordeaux and Bayonne,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-08.png	and that there was no hope of final victory
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-019/g01-019-09.png	without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-00.png	Social service as a function of government
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-01.png	was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-02.png	substitute was the mutual self-help of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-03.png	communities, whether those communities were
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-04.png	monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-05.png	guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-06.png	therefore in essence a forced payment whose
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-07.png	return was the uncertain bounty of booty
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-08.png	and the vague advantages of military glory;
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-09.png	it was therefore always granted grudgingly
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-031/g01-031-10.png	and coupled with the vain hope that, in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-00.png	When 'his' war did not bring victory and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-01.png	booty, a new group of Lords might oust
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-02.png	the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-03.png	who usually supplied the hard cash, might
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-04.png	be bold enough to demand the production of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-05.png	accounts, and even at times the impeachment of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-06.png	the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-07.png	the people, and even a full Parliament was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-034/g01-034-08.png	not yet a true mirror of the nation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-00.png	The people - Langland's 'folk' and Gaunt's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-01.png	'knaves' - were villeins still tied to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-02.png	feudal obligations of work or villeins who
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-03.png	had bought their release, free labourers
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-04.png	who worked for the highest bidders, free
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-05.png	yeomen who had prospered enough to become
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-06.png	successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-07.png	journeymen and small tradesmen of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-08.png	towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-037/g01-037-09.png	in the pay of landed Lords.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-00.png	None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-01.png	expected to pay direct taxes. During the four-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-02.png	teenth century, the traditional methods of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-03.png	financing the Exchequer had become stabilized.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-04.png	When the King and his Council required additio-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-05.png	nal funds, they were usually granted an
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-06.png	export tax on the wool trade, collected by
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-07.png	means of that 'staple' system which ensured that
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-08.png	prices, quality and tax could be efficiently su-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-039/g01-039-09.png	pervised and controlled, together with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-00.png	There were two other sources of public revenue -
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-01.png	first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-02.png	of the Commons and in its own Convocations
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-03.png	granted equivalent contributions, and second,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-04.png	the foreign merchants, with whom the King's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-05.png	officials had formerly made private bargains
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-06.png	at 'colloquies of merchants', and whose
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-07.png	payments were now authorized by parliamentary
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-08.png	sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-043/g01-043-09.png	excess of the rate for native merchants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-00.png	In addition to these revenues, the King had the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-01.png	financial benefits of his position at the head
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-02.png	of the feudal system, as its chief landowner
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-03.png	and the recipient of the fines of royal justice.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-04.png	It was, therefore, a complicated and not very
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-05.png	satisfactory financial system in which the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-06.png	borders between private and public purse were
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-07.png	as ill-defined as the borders between private
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-08.png	and national war, and in which the comparati-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-045/g01-045-09.png	vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-00.png	A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-01.png	to mediaeval eyes. It was determined that 100,000
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-02.png	was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-03.png	two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-04.png	the remainder. The method of assessment to which the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-05.png	Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-06.png	injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-07.png	corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-08.png	but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-09.png	weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
dataset/iam_lines/data/g01/g01-083/g01-083-10.png	had to pay three groats, but this time an adult was re-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-00.png	The questions about children were the same as in 1951,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-01.png	except that they extended to all women who were or had
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-02.png	been married. It was not regarded as practicable within
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-03.png	the limits of the census to include particulars about
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-04.png	the date of birth of each child, as had been done
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-004/h01-004-05.png	in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-00.png	Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-01.png	ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-02.png	the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-03.png	of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-04.png	thus synchronous with cardiac systole but,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-05.png	when movement of blood through arteries is
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-06.png	hindered by compression, infarction or inter-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-07.png	ception, the more distal arteries pulsate
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-08.png	less because their pulse is nothing other
dataset/iam_lines/data/g02/g02-065/g02-065-09.png	than the impulse of the blood entering them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-00.png	When eventually the ovens were fixed at the new shop, the tremen-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-01.png	dously hard work was if anything intensified. George used to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-02.png	mix 100 stone of bread in 12 hours, and Kate served in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-03.png	shop, which was open from 8 o'clock in the morning to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-04.png	12 o'clock at night. At that time pastries and buns
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-004/g03-004-05.png	were sold at 32 pieces for one shilling.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-00.png	(In this strike, as reported in the Sheffield
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-01.png	Guardian in March of that year, 1,000,000
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-02.png	men were out a fortnight, disciplined and solid,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-03.png	when only 20 per cent of them stood to gain
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-04.png	anything from the strike and the other 80 per
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-05.png	cent made sacrifices for their fellow men;
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-06.png	this remarkable strike raised the question of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-07.png	living wage and showed the worth of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-016/g03-016-08.png	common man.)
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-00.png	One of the students was young
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-01.png	George, and another the dark-haired
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-02.png	little granddaughter of Charlie Grant.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-03.png	George often spoke at the Sunday school.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-04.png	He christened the babies. Also, when
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-05.png	called upon to do so, he would officiate
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-06.png	at funerals. Religion was one of his pet
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-07.png	subjects, for being well acquainted
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-08.png	with the Bible, which he had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-09.png	read in prison where it was the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g03/g03-043/g03-043-10.png	only book they were allowed,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-00.png	After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-01.png	Germany for ten years, by which time in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-02.png	1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-03.png	Towards the end of my five and a half years'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-04.png	incumbency I was asked if I would start
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-05.png	a village choral society and conduct it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-06.png	This opened up a new interest, and we plunged
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-022/g04-022-07.png	into it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-00.png	IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-01.png	Vicar of St. Mark's, Woodcote, Purley, a new church built
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-02.png	by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-03.png	who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-04.png	later on joint executor of his estate with his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-05.png	solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-06.png	ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-036/g04-036-07.png	great family consultations.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-00.png	My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-01.png	his family, and found a very suitable house nearby
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-02.png	where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-03.png	at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-04.png	at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-05.png	This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-06.png	Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-039/g04-039-07.png	a close friend of ours.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-00.png	But what a change from the dear little old church
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-01.png	at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-02.png	at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-03.png	church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-04.png	had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-05.png	chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-06.png	When we had found a group of people who gladly
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-07.png	co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-043/g04-043-08.png	of daily prayer.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-00.png	I suggested to the congregation that it needed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-01.png	warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-02.png	found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-03.png	stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-04.png	helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-05.png	for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-06.png	gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-048/g04-048-07.png	windows.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-00.png	It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-01.png	such a beautiful building with suitable fittings; I made
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-02.png	a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-03.png	the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-04.png	to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-05.png	and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-052/g04-052-06.png	table to the environs.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-00.png	We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-01.png	the Brighton Road, in a street full of small houses.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-02.png	This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-03.png	there, but was soon changed into the better-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-04.png	sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-05.png	were lots of children there, and we had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-06.png	a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-07.png	service. I soon saw that the parish needed
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-08.png	more help both at the church and Mission
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-055/g04-055-09.png	district.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-00.png	Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-01.png	co-operation especially with the other Christian communities.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-02.png	At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-03.png	'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-04.png	I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-05.png	wives and relations of the soldiers to get their 'Separation'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-06.png	allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began and increased
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-07.png	in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-08.png	became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-068/g04-068-09.png	of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-00.png	Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-01.png	Purley, and from 1922 at Surbiton, I was continuously
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-02.png	Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-03.png	task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-04.png	the Committee. We had a splendid body of local residents,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-05.png	and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-06.png	Committee met once a week in the evenings, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-07.png	included professional men from every walk of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-072/g04-072-08.png	life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-00.png	Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-01.png	were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen. Life was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-02.png	in those years more than busy. We now had a vicarage next
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-03.png	to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-04.png	years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-05.png	well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-077/g04-077-06.png	church.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-00.png	On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-01.png	Purley she offered to come and look after me. She was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-02.png	a real treasure, of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-03.png	things, a widow who knew how to look after the 'boy,'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-04.png	who was the only other occupant of the house when
dataset/iam_lines/data/g04/g04-081/g04-081-05.png	Mr. Evitt had gone.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-01.png	Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-02.png	much as his health permitted him to enjoy any-
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-03.png	thing. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-04.png	is a great resource. Vesuvius seems to be tired;

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-07.png	other man was a priest: here the priest is
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-08.png	1superceded by the soldier - a favourable change
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-09.png	in my eye, particularly as the troops are very
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011a/g06-011a-10.png	fine.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-01.png	back to England, and returned to Rome for the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-02.png	winter. In late November, he was 'suffering as
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-03.png	usual', but hoped, he told Arthur, 'to find
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-04.png	this place agree with me better than Naples.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018a/g06-018a-05.png	The journey has been against me, as there has

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-03.png	one word of English.' While he was writing
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-04.png	this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs, and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-05.png	temporary assumption of the government by
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026a/g06-026a-06.png	the Duke of Wellington.

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-01.png	the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-02.png	advise Anglesey to give the system a trial, adding
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-03.png	that it was being cultivated with extraordinary
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-04.png	success in France and Italy, and that he
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-05.png	himself was being treated under a doctor who
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-06.png	had studied under its founder, the aged
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045a/g06-045a-07.png	Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-02.png	as 'more like a God upon earth than a human
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-03.png	being', had an increasing number of disciples
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-04.png	among unorthodox medical men in the cities
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-05.png	of Europe. One of these was the Neapolitan,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-06.png	Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey consulted
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047a/g06-047a-07.png	in # May 1834.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-01.png	master at Ko"then, near Leipzig, asking for advice.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-02.png	In doing so he described his distinguished patient
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-03.png	and his symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-04.png	found Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-05.png	gentle and charming character, even-tempered
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050a/g06-050a-06.png	and sedate, not easily irritated, patient and

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047b/g06-047b-05.png	in the cities of Europe. One of these
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047b/g06-047b-06.png	was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047b/g06-047b-07.png	whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-01.png	master at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-02.png	advice. In doing so he described his distinguished
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-03.png	patient and his symptoms. He told Hahnemann
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-04.png	that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic man
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-05.png	with a gentle and charming character,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-06.png	even-tempered and sedate, not easily irritated,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-07.png	patient and persevering, 'but he appears to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050b/g06-050b-08.png	despair of ever being cured.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011e/g06-011e-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011e/g06-011e-01.png	He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011e/g06-011e-02.png	health permitted him to enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011e/g06-011e-03.png	wrote, 'is arrived, which is a great resource. Vesuvius
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011e/g06-011e-04.png	seems to be tired; he is going out fast.... What a gay,

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-03.png	him off yesterday.' While he was in Naples
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-04.png	there had opened a new chapter in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-05.png	history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-06.png	effective alleviation of his painful malady.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-07.png	None of the numerous conventional remedies to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-08.png	which he had been subjected ever since the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-09.png	symptoms had first shown themselves seventeen
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-037m/g06-037m-10.png	years before had had the slightest effect.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-00.png	In April of that year his first wife's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-01.png	brother-in-law, the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-02.png	had written to advise Anglesey to give the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-03.png	system a trial, adding that it was being
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-04.png	cultivated with extraordinary success in
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-05.png	France and Italy, and that he himself was
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-06.png	being treated under a doctor who had
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-07.png	studied under its founder, the aged
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-045m/g06-045m-08.png	Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-00.png	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-01.png	Francis Burdett described to Anglesey a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-02.png	year or two later as 'more like a God
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-03.png	upon earth than a human being', had an
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-04.png	increasing number of disciples among
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-05.png	unorthodox medical men in the cities of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-06.png	Europe. One of these was the Neapolitan,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-07.png	Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-047m/g06-047m-08.png	consulted in May 1834.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-00.png	Mauro's first action was to write to his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-01.png	revered master at Ko"then, near Leipzig, asking
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-02.png	for advice. In doing so he described his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-03.png	distinguished patient and his symptoms. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-04.png	told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-05.png	strong, energetic man with a gentle and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-06.png	charming character, even-tempered and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-07.png	sedate, not easily irritated, patient and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-08.png	persevering, 'but he appears to despair
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-050m/g06-050m-09.png	of ever being cured.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-00.png	By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-01.png	told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his health
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-02.png	permitted him to enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-03.png	'is arrived, which is a great resource. Vesuvius seems
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-04.png	to be tired; he is going out fast.... What a gay, lively
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-05.png	people, and what a busy town. At Rome, every other
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-06.png	man was a priest: here the priest is 1superceded by
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-07.png	the soldier - a favourable change in my eye,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-011p/g06-011p-08.png	particularly as the troops are very fine.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-00.png	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl back to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-01.png	England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-02.png	late November, he was 'suffering as usual', but hoped,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-03.png	he told Arthur, 'to find this place agree with me
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-04.png	better than Naples. The journey has been against me,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-05.png	as there has been much rain and damp, but the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-018p/g06-018p-06.png	temperature is high & I have not yet thought of a

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026p/g06-026p-01.png	Italian who is perhaps the best Valet de Chambre
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026p/g06-026p-02.png	that ever was. But he has not one word of English.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026p/g06-026p-03.png	While he was writing this letter he heard of the fall
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026p/g06-026p-04.png	of the Whigs, and the temporary assumption of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-026p/g06-026p-05.png	government by the Duke of Wellington.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-031p/g06-031p-00.png	'What a frightful event!' he wrote. 'I tremble! What infa-

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-00.png	Later in the year, the idea of some sort of
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-01.png	public employment was again in the air. Lady
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-02.png	Cowper, for instance, told Princess Lieven on
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-03.png	September 25th that Anglesey was very much
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-04.png	annoyed at not obtaining the Admiralty in place
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-05.png	of Lord Auckland, who had gone to govern India.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-06.png	If there was any truth in this, Lord Melbourne's
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-089/g06-089-07.png	letter of the following day, offering Anglesey the

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-093/g06-093-00.png	'It is', he wrote, 'one of the best military situations

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-00.png	It was no longer necessary to go further than Paris,

dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-02.png	from his native Germany by the antipathy of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-03.png	orthodox brethren. The main difficulty was how to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-04.png	make the expedition from England without killing the
dataset/iam_lines/data/g06/g06-105/g06-105-05.png	patient before he completed it. The problem was

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-01.png	communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-02.png	satirical: 'I have not the 1honor of any acquaintance with Mr

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-04.png	Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....'
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-05.png	If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-06.png	Government's other representatives in the islands, while they
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-07.png	warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far to
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-08.png	explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-003b/g07-003b-09.png	Italian's expense.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-00.png	In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-01.png	Shelley, Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-02.png	and Tita and the steward, Lega Zambelli, failed to perform
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-03.png	the most elementary duties towards the dead. He pretends
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-04.png	to have found everything in uttermost disorder - 'tokens that
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-05.png	the Pilgrim had most treasured, scattered on the floor, -
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-06.png	as rubbish of no marketable value, and trampled on'.
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-00.png	This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-01.png	letter to his sister, which was that its chance of reaching its
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-02.png	destination had seemed slight. The collection of Pietro
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-03.png	Gamba's letters deposited among the Murray manuscripts show
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-04.png	that the greatest care was observed in gathering together all the possessions
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-05.png	of a man whose importance was fully recognized by everyone about
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-06.png	him. 'I have had put under Government seal his belongings,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-010b/g07-010b-07.png	which will be opened by Prince Alexander Mavrocordato

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-00.png	I have taken an exact inventory of them.' Thus on April 21st, several
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-01.png	days before Trelawny appeared, Gamba wrote to Lord Sidney Osborne,
dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-02.png	and his inventory has been preserved. The papers were reopened in

dataset/iam_lines/data/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-04.png	sure that no recent will was amongst them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-00.png	Questions about marriage and children were
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-01.png	again included, as they had been at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-02.png	1911 and 1951 Censuses. The former had asked
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-03.png	for marriage details for all married women,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-04.png	the latter for all married women under
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-05.png	the age of 50. The 1961 Census questions
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-06.png	related to all women who were or had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-07.png	married, and so repeated the enquiry made
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-08.png	fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-09.png	Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-000/h01-000-10.png	Commission on Population.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-00.png	The innovation at the 1961 Census, though the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-01.png	Family Census had previously included
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-02.png	the question, was the date of termination
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-03.png	of the first or only marriage. This enables
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-04.png	statistical use to be made of their experience
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-05.png	as regards duration of marriage and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-06.png	number of children in the case of women
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-07.png	whose first or only marriage was terminated
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-08.png	by widowhood or divorce after the end
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-007/h01-007-09.png	of their child bearing life.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-00.png	This is particularly important in estimating the trends
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-01.png	in the size and pattern of families for successive
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-02.png	generations over as long a period as possible, as the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-03.png	proportion of widows predominates in the higher age
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-04.png	groups. In Wales and Monmouthshire the question
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-05.png	on the ability to speak Welsh was included as
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-06.png	previously. The question was first asked in 1891, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-010/h01-010-07.png	was given its present form in 1931.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-00.png	Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-01.png	about housing and households. In 1961 the scope of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-02.png	question was wider than before, because of the great
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-03.png	use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-04.png	Government and to local authorities. As before, the record
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-05.png	made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residen-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-06.png	tial premises and temporary places of abode, and all
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-07.png	households occupying them, as the basis of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-014/h01-014-08.png	enumeration is the household schedule.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-00.png	The number of structurally separate dwellings (that is,
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-01.png	houses or flats or other quarters built or adapted for
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-02.png	separate occupation and forming a private and structurally
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-03.png	separate unit) was obtained as previously, together with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-04.png	number of households with sole occupation or sharing
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-05.png	such dwellings, and the number of living rooms occu-
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-018/h01-018-06.png	pied by each household.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-00.png	Previously, while visitors were left out of this
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-01.png	analysis it was not considered sufficiently
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-02.png	important to attempt the task of bringing
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-03.png	in the members away from home on Census
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-04.png	night, which would be very laborious in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-05.png	absence of information given at their place
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-06.png	of usual residence (n log n). But the need
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-07.png	for a more accurate distribution of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-08.png	households by size as usually constituted
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-09.png	had become more important by 1961, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h01/h01-027/h01-027-10.png	accordingly a new question was introduced, ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-00.png	As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence, though
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-01.png	we found it an advantage in certain instances. Appendix
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-02.png	1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-03.png	Department of Health for Scotland, the Home Office and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-04.png	the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us;
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-05.png	officers of these Departments attended our meetings
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-008/h02-008-06.png	and have given us valuable assistance.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-00.png	On 23rd November, 1959, we submitted
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-01.png	an Interim Report. This dealt with two questions
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-02.png	which arose from our terms of reference and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-03.png	which had been brought specially to our notice.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-04.png	First, we were asked to examine the risks
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-05.png	attending the abuse of carbromal and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-06.png	bromvaletone and preparations containing these
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-07.png	substances. The Poisons Board had already
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-08.png	considered this problem but, in the absence of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-012/h02-012-09.png	sufficient evidence that these compounds
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-00.png	The Thetans must not see him! He took another route
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-01.png	to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-02.png	the way. Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-03.png	once; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-04.png	their situation, as far as it could be assessed,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-05.png	and to decide on what seemed to be the best
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-100/m01-100-06.png	way of meeting it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-00.png	The Secretary of State was empowered, on the recommendation of a
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-01.png	tribunal, to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-02.png	dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor, or a doctor
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-03.png	convicted of an offence under the Act, should not issue
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-04.png	prescriptions for dangerous drugs. (3) It was made clear
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-05.png	that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-06.png	medical practitioner when required for purposes of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h02/h02-049/h02-049-07.png	medical treatment.
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-00.png	The price ranges for milk,

dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-02.png	were very narrow. For most other
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-03.png	foods younger childless couples paid
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-04.png	the highest average prices and
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-05.png	large families the lowest, the price
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-06.png	gradients being steepest for
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-07.png	carcase meat (+7 to -7 per cent),
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-08.png	"other" fish (+8 to -11), "other" vegetables
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-09.png	(+9 to -9) and beverages other than
dataset/iam_lines/data/h04/h04-028/h04-028-10.png	tea (+12 to -16).
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-087/h07-087-00.png	Tables C, D and E of Appendix 16 give details of
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-087/h07-087-01.png	factories, shops and offices completed and under
dataset/iam_lines/data/h07/h07-087/h07-087-02.png	construction at the end of the year.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-00.png	This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-01.png	obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-02.png	aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-03.png	for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-04.png	the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-05.png	became established for aero-engine radiators, using
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-06.png	dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-000/j07-000-07.png	were separated by flat plates.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-00.png	This development coincided with the introduction of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-01.png	pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-02.png	cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-03.png	coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-04.png	were of comparable magnitude, the use of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-05.png	secondary surface was still attractive, since the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-06.png	greater part of the surface area could be made up
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-009/j07-009-07.png	of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-00.png	Furthermore, developments in the detail form of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-01.png	the fins made possible a reduction in the total
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-02.png	surface area required as compared with the use of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-03.png	smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-04.png	duty and pressure losses. The properties of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-05.png	compact form, low weight, and design flexibility
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-06.png	thus developed found ready application on a
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-07.png	much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-012/j07-012-08.png	scale air separation plants.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-00.png	The basic method of construction is both simple and
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-01.png	extremely flexible. Figure 3 illustrates the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-02.png	arrangement of a single passage. This can be
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-03.png	extended in length and width up to the limit of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-04.png	manufacturing equipment available. The corrugation
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-05.png	is machine-formed, thus ensuring a high standard
dataset/iam_lines/data/j07/j07-015/j07-015-06.png	of uniformity in height and fin pitch.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j01/j01-063/j01-063-00.png	Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is

dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-01.png	precipitates need be known because the concentration
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-02.png	of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-03.png	algebraic equations. An effort was made to
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-04.png	detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-05.png	the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-06.png	bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-07.png	of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-015/j04-015-08.png	minutes of completing the separation.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-00.png	Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-01.png	minimum but the accuracy and precision of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-02.png	weighing the precipitated sources suffers. All
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-03.png	precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-04.png	which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-05.png	weights from the National Physical Laboratory.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-06.png	Complete chemical exchange between the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-07.png	radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-08.png	necessary if the analytical results are to
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-035/j04-035-09.png	be correct.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-00.png	The presence and growth of algae in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-01.png	alkaline effluent does not prevent the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-02.png	recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-03.png	conditions although some radioactivity remains
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-04.png	on the algae until the metathesis has been
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-05.png	completed by heating the mixed sulphates
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-06.png	with three separate portions of dilute (1.25
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-07.png	normal) sodium carbonate solution. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-08.png	strength of the carbonate solution was
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-09.png	chosen after experiments with lead tracer
dataset/iam_lines/data/j04/j04-046/j04-046-10.png	alone which indicated that less lead was
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-00.png	But normal movements have been
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-01.png	reported also for the same species in
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-02.png	the case of five of these examples
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-03.png	and for other species in the same
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-04.png	genera for the remaining Evadne,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-05.png	Daphnia, and Diaptomus. Many
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-06.png	forms sometimes migrate and on other
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-07.png	occasions do not, but a few
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-08.png	appear to remain permanently at
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-09.png	one level. Considering the widespread
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-018/j06-018-10.png	incidence of migration in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-00.png	The most clearly substantiated case
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-01.png	is that of the copepod Anomalocera
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-02.png	patersoni, which remains permanently
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-03.png	at the surface. Among other copepods
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-04.png	Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-05.png	Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oithona
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-06.png	frigida, and Centropages typicus are
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-07.png	reported as showing no migration.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-08.png	The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-09.png	longimanus also remains at one
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-022/j06-022-10.png	level, about 10 meters down.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-00.png	In view of its well-known normal
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-01.png	migration, the occurrence of Calanus
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-02.png	finmarchicus in the summer at
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-03.png	the surface in bright sunlight
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-04.png	may justly be considered anomalous.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-05.png	This phenomenon has nevertheless been
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-06.png	recorded many times, and such
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-07.png	surface Calanus may be present in
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-08.png	enormous numbers, breaking the surface
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-026/j06-026-09.png	into small circular ripples like
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-00.png	It seems likely that a continuous
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-01.png	interchange was taking place between
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-02.png	the population at the surface and
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-03.png	that in deeper water. A second
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-04.png	group whose normal vertical
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-05.png	migration is sufficiently well
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-06.png	known to make daytime
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-07.png	occurrence at the surface
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-08.png	rank as anomalous is the
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-09.png	Euphausiacea. There are numerous
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-030/j06-030-10.png	records of euphausiids swimming
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-00.png	2. Mechanisms. The majority of
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-01.png	vertical migrations undoubtedly
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-02.png	result from active swimming
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-03.png	although passive movement through
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-04.png	the water has been suggested on
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-05.png	various grounds. For example,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-06.png	transport in vertical currents
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-07.png	resulting from temperature diff-
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-08.png	erences has been proposed; diff-
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-09.png	erences in water viscosity after
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-034/j06-034-10.png	temperature changes have also been
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-00.png	Downward movement may in some forms
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-01.png	start as a passive sinking, especially
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-02.png	when it occurs before dawn; but this
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-03.png	must almost certainly be replaced
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-04.png	by the headfirst downward swimming
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-05.png	observed in the field. 3. Initiating,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-06.png	controlling, and orienting factors. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-07.png	primary dependence of diurnal
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-08.png	migrations upon changes in light intensity
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-09.png	is beyond doubt. Yet in spite
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-051/j06-051-10.png	of a great amount of work,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-00.png	Loeb first suggested the importance
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-01.png	of light as the governing factor
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-02.png	but combined its influence with that
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-03.png	of gravity. Later authors, in particular
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-04.png	Rose, have proposed that light
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-05.png	alone can provide an adequate
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-06.png	mechanism if the animals have,
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-07.png	and select by exploration, a
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-08.png	zone of optimum light intensity.
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-09.png	This view has been enlarged
dataset/iam_lines/data/j06/j06-056/j06-056-10.png	with a suggestion that both
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-00.png	If anything, he had merely become a little more reserved, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-01.png	much more polite. I thought to myself: 'A few years in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-02.png	East, my boy, and you'll drink - I've seen your kind be-
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-03.png	fore!' After the curry, I wanted only to go upstairs to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-04.png	bed. I had long since become accustomed, and now addicted,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-05.png	to an after-curry nap.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-023/k02-023-06.png	Verena Holenstein
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-00.png	Lee, however, showed not the slightest sign of fatigue. 'I
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-01.png	wonder if you'd mind if I took a bit of a look round,'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-02.png	he asked Nigel. 'I don't sleep in the afternoons.' Nigel,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-03.png	I must say, was very good about it. I knew how much
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-04.png	he probably wanted to sleep himself. But, almost
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-029/k02-029-05.png	gallantly, he said:
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-00.png	The Prime Minister looked puzzled, and said, 'Julia Drayford? How
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-01.png	does she come into it? I can't follow these complexities -' 'It isn't
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-02.png	quite that. The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-03.png	indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-04.png	I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-180/k03-180-05.png	what.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-00.png	And I said to myself: Oh, God, doesn't the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-01.png	boy ever relax! He turned his gaze away
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-02.png	from me almost instantly, but it had
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-03.png	been enough to make me conscious of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-04.png	nakedness of the upper half of my body, even
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-05.png	of the matted grey hairs on my chest. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-06.png	probably thought my appearance quite a breach
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-07.png	of the social graces; but, naturally, he said
dataset/iam_lines/data/k02/k02-062/k02-062-08.png	not so much as a word about it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-00.png	'It comes at a bad time,' said
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-01.png	Ormston. 'A singularly bad time. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-02.png	Party's very restless, you know.' 'It
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-03.png	is a sign of life - very encouraging!'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-04.png	'The younger men -' 'Which ones?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-05.png	'The younger ones like Gore, Vaughan,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-06.png	Hadley, Prebble, Lambert-Price - the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-07.png	New Africa lot -' 'Do they confide
dataset/iam_lines/data/k03/k03-144/k03-144-08.png	in you? Have you spoken to them?'
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-00.png	He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-01.png	custom, and dwell there with their relations. Her
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-02.png	values were those of the materialist who assesses
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-03.png	every human being in terms of fame, power and
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-04.png	wealth. Francesco she despised for his dullness, his
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-064/k04-064-05.png	lack of initiative, his subservience to his uncle.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-00.png	Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-01.png	love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-02.png	futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-03.png	her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-04.png	first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-05.png	She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-06.png	Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-07.png	come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-068/k04-068-08.png	with a weight of misgiving.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-00.png	Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-01.png	coach now turned in another direction, towards
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-02.png	the wild and desolate region behind the baths.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-03.png	It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-04.png	and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-05.png	a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-099/k04-099-06.png	reminder of Rome's former greatness.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-00.png	In this region of Monti most of the public baths
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-01.png	had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-02.png	breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-03.png	the baths had lost their purpose; they had become
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-04.png	stone quarries and their precious marble had been
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-05.png	burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-06.png	used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-103/k04-103-07.png	of travellers in the district.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-00.png	'In that case,' he reverted to French, 'I shall be obliged
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-01.png	to lift you from the coach.' Without answering him, she
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-02.png	rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly:
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-03.png	'No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here.' Ignoring his
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-04.png	proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle. 'Will you
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-05.png	be so good as to order your men not to molest my
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-156/k04-156-06.png	maid,' she said coldly to Orsini.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-00.png	'She is absolutely safe,' he replied; but he turned,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-01.png	nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-02.png	coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-03.png	instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her,
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-04.png	breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-05.png	away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-06.png	of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple
dataset/iam_lines/data/k04/k04-163/k04-163-07.png	were etched against the clear blue of the sky.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-00.png	You perverted sex-maniac, you wouldn't
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-01.png	dare. Show me what you can do and
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-02.png	I'll tell you if you need help.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-03.png	Once he came back to the subject
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-04.png	of her marriage and asked her why
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-05.png	she was going to marry her sculptor.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-06.png	Because I love him, of course.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-152/k07-152-07.png	What do you think?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-00.png	But he's a lot older, isn't he?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-01.png	I suppose so. What attracts you?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-02.png	It can't be physical? Of course
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-03.png	not! I love him for what he is
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-04.png	- he's so great I'm a bit scared
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-05.png	of him - a woman must be a bit
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-06.png	scared to be really in love.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-07.png	That's why you could never
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-158/k07-158-08.png	love me?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-00.png	Correct, ducky! You just wait till
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-01.png	you meet the girl who thinks you're a
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-02.png	god. It'll make you feel like one!
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-03.png	You think that sculptor's a god?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-04.png	Perhaps, in a way. All I know is
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-05.png	that I need him. He kissed the
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-06.png	heart beat in her throat. But how
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-07.png	about the physical side? You're
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-08.png	quite an erotic little beast; can
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-166/k07-166-09.png	he satisfy that?
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-00.png	You youngsters always overestimate
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-01.png	yourselves. You can take it from
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-02.png	me that he can and does. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-03.png	even if he were impotent I'd still
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-04.png	love and want him. There are
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-05.png	sides to me you'll never know.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-06.png	Don't you feel guilty living with
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-07.png	me? Often! Don't you? Mary had
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-08.png	married her bill broker some time
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-09.png	ago and he now shuddered when he
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-10.png	remembered the clinical weekends
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-176/k07-176-11.png	he used to spend with her.
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-00.png	He often used to try to imagine
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-01.png	her reactions if he had once treated
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-02.png	her as he did Charlie, but his
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-03.png	imagination failed. The efficient
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-04.png	little Mary would probably have
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-05.png	called it a shocking waste of time
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-06.png	and told him to get down to
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-07.png	business! Charlie, who was perfectly
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-08.png	at home at all sorts of artistic
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-09.png	circles, had amongst others wangled
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-10.png	him a membership ticket for a
dataset/iam_lines/data/k07/k07-185/k07-185-11.png	small club for artists only.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-00.png	He did well. He got in touch with
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-01.png	the woman Pete was passing off as his
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-02.png	mother. Starmouth managed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-03.png	win her confidence. It seems that
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-04.png	she was an honest enough woman,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-05.png	only her mind wasn't as clear as
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-06.png	it could have been. She showed
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-07.png	him photographs. He found out
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-08.png	that the name of her house - Grand
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-09.png	Greve - was taken from a bay
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-000/l01-000-10.png	in one of the Channel Islands.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-00.png	He sponged off him until he died
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-01.png	just after the war. Then Pete had to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-02.png	look around for some other
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-03.png	security. He found it - Dackson's Wharf,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-04.png	and Dackson's daughter. Mrs. Caxton's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-05.png	other boy, Derek, had been killed in the war.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-06.png	After her husband died her brain began
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-07.png	to fade. At times she thought Pete was
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-030/l01-030-08.png	really her own son.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-00.png	Carol Carstairs, interviewed by
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-01.png	Passon and Tong for the second time,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-02.png	began by agreeing that she could
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-03.png	have been mistaken about the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-04.png	precise minute of Dackson's visit
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-05.png	the previous Wednesday, and ended
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-06.png	by admitting that he was in fact
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-07.png	at least half an hour late for
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-08.png	his appointment with her. &quot;There
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-09.png	it is,&quot; Passon commented
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-10.png	afterwards. &quot;She is a business
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-065/l01-065-11.png	woman.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-00.png	He argued that it was the only place where
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-01.png	he could be safe from Rose. &quot;See here, Sam,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-02.png	Nick began. &quot;You know Fred's getting spliced.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-03.png	&quot;Gone soft in the head,&quot; Sam said. &quot;Same as
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-04.png	I've always said, women rule the roost and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-05.png	no man's safe from 'em. Ought to be a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-06.png	better way of doing things. Take trees.&quot; He
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-157/l01-157-07.png	rattled on very happily.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-00.png	&quot;Imagine it, Nick, just that bit of information
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-01.png	Fred picked up about Pete Jesty always touching
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-02.png	his nose, and me remembering from that
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-03.png	snap you once showed me that this Cax-
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-04.png	ton had some sort of a scar there. Just
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-05.png	an idea to begin with, mind you - then
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-06.png	click! and I'd got it. That was smart
dataset/iam_lines/data/l01/l01-195/l01-195-07.png	work, say what you like.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-00.png	&quot;Why?&quot; he asked again. &quot;I can tell by your voice that it means
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-01.png	a lot to you, but I'm damned if I can see the reason. It's not as
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-02.png	if you were all that fond of Alice.&quot; He was interrupted by the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-03.png	arrival of the food and wine. When the pouring ritual was over he
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-052/l07-052-04.png	went on:
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-00.png	If he didn't do it it must have been -&quot; &quot;Must have been
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-01.png	who?&quot; Max prompted. I looked into his eyes and longed
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-02.png	with all my heart to tell him, but I could not do it.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-03.png	As long as my suspicion remained in my head I could pretend
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-065/l07-065-04.png	to myself, in moments of optimism, that it was not true.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-00.png	If you're right, you may be in serious danger from Hardy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-01.png	Even if you're wrong you'll most certainly be in danger when
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-02.png	you start handling a boat.&quot; He picked up his glass and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-03.png	held it in both hands, looking at me thoughtfully over the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-04.png	top of it. &quot;No,&quot; he said at last. &quot;I can't allow # #
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-074/l07-074-05.png	it.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-00.png	Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-01.png	and helped me out with the same
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-02.png	careful courtesy. &quot;What sort of boat is it?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-03.png	I asked. &quot;She,&quot; he corrected. &quot;She's a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-04.png	converted life-boat. Not a very good one,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-05.png	but she's sound enough and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-118/l07-118-06.png	engine's fine.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-00.png	Inside, she was untidy and grubby but
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-01.png	roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-02.png	good-sized windows. It was a long time
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-03.png	before I got used to calling them
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-04.png	portholes. The owner was a middle-aged
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-05.png	man whose family had tired of the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-06.png	limited excitement of the river and now
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-131/l07-131-07.png	had their eyes on a seagoing boat.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-00.png	Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-01.png	haggled with him and within half an hour
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-02.png	Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-03.png	fifty pounds. When all the business details
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-04.png	had been settled and the owner had
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-05.png	departed with my cheque in his pocket,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-06.png	Clive started the engine and gave me my
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-07.png	first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-135/l07-135-08.png	the river and in and out of the other boats.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-00.png	It was a warm, still evening; the plop of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-01.png	fish and the gentle putter of the engine
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-02.png	were infinitely soothing after city noises,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-03.png	and I began to look forward to my life
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-04.png	on the water. At last he pronounced
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-05.png	me riverworthy and wanted to know when
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-138/l07-138-06.png	I would be moving in.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-00.png	Like Clive, he was enthusiastic about the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-01.png	engine and decided, apparently on the strength
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-02.png	of its efficiency, that Sandpiper was fit to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-03.png	live in. I was more than thankful for his help
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-04.png	when we had installed my things and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-05.png	boat began to move. The river was crowded
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-06.png	with flocks of sailing boats which
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-07.png	swirled round us like gulls and there
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-08.png	were two locks to negotiate, but Max
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-09.png	seemed to know exactly what to do
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-172/l07-172-10.png	and at the same time kept me supplied
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-00.png	"How on earth do you know all this?" I asked
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-01.png	him. "I used to play about in these things
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-02.png	when I was a kid. And then I acted as guide
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-03.png	on a river boat one summer, to keep myself
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-04.png	going between terms at college." It was
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-05.png	the first I had heard of it, but that's
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-176/l07-176-06.png	one of the things I like about Max.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-00.png	He has done so many things that there
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-01.png	is always something new and exciting to
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-02.png	discover about him. "You're wonderful," I
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-03.png	said, meaning it. He pressed the tip of my
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-04.png	nose with one finger. "That makes two of us."
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-05.png	It was about eight o'clock in the evening
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-06.png	when we tied up almost exactly opposite
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-07.png	Hardy's garden and went up on to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-181/l07-181-08.png	roof of the cabin to see what we could see.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-00.png	From this side, Rivermead was less forbidding;
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-01.png	it stood a long way back from the water
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-02.png	at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-03.png	flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-04.png	the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-05.png	ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria; it
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-06.png	was built across a narrow backwater
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-07.png	and there was a delicate iron staircase
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-187/l07-187-08.png	climbing the outer wall to a room above.
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-00.png	"You won't see anyone tonight, it's too late," Max
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-01.png	said and turned to go. "No - wait," I put out a
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-02.png	hand to stop him. The sun was no longer shining
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-03.png	and it was dark across there by the trees,
dataset/iam_lines/data/l07/l07-190/l07-190-04.png	but I thought I had seen something move.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-00.png	A shudder, more mental than physical, ran
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-01.png	through him, and his mind seemed to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-02.png	melt away into emptiness. His bulging
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-03.png	eyes caught the reclining form of Heather,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-04.png	who was still repeating in sing-song:
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-05.png	&quot;. . . I will not give in. . .&quot; He stared at her
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-06.png	blankly, mouthing an incoherent gabble
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-000/m01-000-07.png	of half words.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-00.png	Then something like a zest for living began to come back
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-01.png	to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-02.png	enough animation to produce a wan smile. Dan's low mut-
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-03.png	tering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-04.png	could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-05.png	she was growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-06.png	Dan, or rather the physical relic of him - the empty
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-07.png	shell of flesh and bone, devoid of intellect and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-032/m01-032-08.png	personality.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-00.png	He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-01.png	and came into the livingroom, where
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-02.png	Heather and Steve stood aghast at
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-03.png	his entrance. He came, almost falling
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-04.png	forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-05.png	thrust out, arms dangling loosely.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-06.png	Then, abruptly, he drew himself up
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-07.png	and walked on the very tips of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-08.png	his toes. He stretched his arms
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-09.png	over his head and yawned agape,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-10.png	drawing-in great breaths that
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-049/m01-049-11.png	became great sighs of ecstacy.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-00.png	After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-01.png	went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-02.png	in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-03.png	went dead again, and Steve had no stomach for
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-04.png	breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-05.png	should be. Steve got out the car and traversed the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-06.png	same empty streets as he had the night before,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-090/m01-090-07.png	to keep an appointment with Heather.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-00.png	After a long wait a bus appeared and they
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-01.png	followed the beaming Dan aboard, taking
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-02.png	seats some rows behind him. Steve was
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-03.png	beginning to find the stereotyped, flattish, happy
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-04.png	faces very disconcerting; and looking at
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-05.png	Heather he found a welcome relief in her
dataset/iam_lines/data/m01/m01-160/m01-160-06.png	relatively long doleful one
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-00.png	Peron entered, a large man, who had once been
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-01.png	handsome but was now seedy-looking, a sufferer
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-02.png	from stomach-ulcers. In the Back-Face tradition he
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-03.png	wore, and kept on indoors, a fifty gallon hat. Harry was
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-04.png	prepared for something unpleasant, for this was
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-05.png	the Senator who had annoyed the United States
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-06.png	by bragging how he had once won a trick from
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-07.png	W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-08.png	rockets (an admission which would scarcely help
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-09.png	bluff to succeed the next time) and, lately, by
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-10.png	saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid
dataset/iam_lines/data/m02/m02-083/m02-083-11.png	of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-00.png	Sally and of course Mrs Septimus, for surely
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-01.png	Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-02.png	myself? But was it so? I allowed myself
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-03.png	to entertain for an instant the idea, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-04.png	strange, the unwelcome, the almost
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-05.png	inconceivable idea, that Ariadne's arrival
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-06.png	would be inopportune; and with the idea came
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-07.png	a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-08.png	to watch Mr Septimus more closely, Mrs
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-110/m03-110-09.png	Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-00.png	But all three were to the casual
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-01.png	observation I permitted myself unruffled;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-02.png	Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-03.png	thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-04.png	we were all invaded by a most tranquil
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-05.png	mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-06.png	so Mr Gilberto told us, that the wild and
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-07.png	savage tribes never approached this region: at
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-08.png	any rate they remained with us, perhaps
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-114/m03-114-09.png	for such protection as our presence, or Mrs
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-00.png	But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-01.png	far from our minds that at any moment we were
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-02.png	to receive a summons. I could see that Mr Septimus
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-03.png	was impatient for it. This afternoon, then, we climbed
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-04.png	a promontory, a mass of clean rock crowned with
dataset/iam_lines/data/m03/m03-118/m03-118-05.png	trees and bushes, that stood well out over the lake.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-00.png	But the jet aircraft was already miles away,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-01.png	swinging down to the darkening earth. &quot;It
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-02.png	passed me at fifty thousand feet, sir. It was
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-03.png	climbing steadily.&quot; Group Captain Llewelyn Jones, Officer
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-04.png	Commanding R.A.F. Station, Dinas, looked keenly at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-05.png	Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-06.png	office. &quot;And what did it look like, Broughtons? Some
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-145/m04-145-07.png	sort of rocket?&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-00.png	Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-01.png	&quot;Well, actually, sir, it looked like - like a bus.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-02.png	A single-decker,&quot; he elaborated. Daggers, the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-03.png	Group Captain looked. &quot;Broughtons,&quot; he said silkily.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-04.png	&quot;Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-05.png	earth-bound creatures? Aeroplanes fly, Broughtons.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-06.png	Buses crawl.&quot; Very pale, Broughtons was. But
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-152/m04-152-07.png	determined. &quot;It was a bus, sir.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-00.png	They'd got the lights on. There were people inside.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-01.png	Waving.&quot; Like gimlets, the Station Commander's eyes.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-02.png	&quot;Did you see the indicator board?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;And
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-03.png	what did it say? Mystery Tour?&quot; Oh, very caustic, that
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-04.png	Group Captain. But Broughtons stood his ground. &quot;No,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-05.png	sir. It said Llangrwl.&quot; Llewelyn Jones sat
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-06.png	back in his chair. &quot;I see. So you met a bus at
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-164/m04-164-07.png	fifty thousand feet.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-00.png	All lit up. Full of people waving as you went past.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-01.png	Suddenly he crouched forward. &quot;Broughtons, if I thought
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-02.png	there were anything in Queen's Regulations to cover this,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-03.png	I'd have you court-martialled. But I know there
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-04.png	isn't,&quot; he ended sadly. &quot;I tried to read the
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-05.png	registration number, sir. But it was getting dark.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-06.png	He waited. But his commanding officer appeared to
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-180/m04-180-07.png	have forgotten him.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-251/m04-251-00.png	&quot;Then we are saved,&quot; cried the Rev. Edwards.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-251/m04-251-01.png	Shyly, Morfydd Owen produced a block of
dataset/iam_lines/data/m04/m04-251/m04-251-02.png	chocolate.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-00.png	Though your wings and your scars are new,
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-01.png	you may join us.' 'I am Lily-yo. We three
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-02.png	are humans. You are only flymen. We will
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-03.png	not join you.' The Captives grunted in boredom.
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-04.png	The Chief Captive spoke again. 'Always this
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-05.png	talk from you of the Heavy World! You have
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-06.png	joined us. You are flymen, we are human. You
dataset/iam_lines/data/m06/m06-019/m06-019-07.png	know little, we know much.'
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-00.png	I saw several men running down towards
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-01.png	the shack. They were all armed with rifles.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-02.png	As the nearest of them came round the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-03.png	shack, his rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-04.png	Dowd, still wearing his blue check shirt. He
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-05.png	came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. &quot;We've
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-06.png	come 2a-calling,&quot; I said. &quot;Can't see no reason
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-07.png	for calling,&quot; he said. &quot;Still long as you're here
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-148/n06-148-08.png	you may as well stay a while.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-00.png	'Light an' come on in.&quot; We dismounted and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-01.png	one of the miners who'd come along with
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-02.png	Nick Dowd took our horses off to water.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-03.png	We followed Nick Dowd into the shack.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-04.png	They'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-05.png	a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-06.png	miners followed in at our heels. Nick Dowd
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-156/n06-156-07.png	found us a couple of boxes to sit on.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-00.png	A small man in bib overalls and a battered
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-01.png	Derby hat fussed around the stove. &quot;2Ain't
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-02.png	exactly the Ritz Hotel but we've got our little
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-03.png	comforts,&quot; said Dowd. He introduced the men
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-04.png	who'd come in as Roper Smith, Shorty, Mick
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-05.png	Golightly, Swede and the Sodbuster. This last was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-06.png	the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-07.png	had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-08.png	sweetened with molasses for all and for us
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-163/n06-163-09.png	there were two plates of beans.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-00.png	&quot;They gives you the wind,&quot; said the Sodbuster
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-01.png	handing them to us, &quot;but it's all we got
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-02.png	as of now, apart from a few sacks of gold
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-03.png	dust.&quot; He winked at his partners. They all
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-04.png	watched us as we ate the beans. Then when
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-05.png	we'd finished and I'd rolled a cigarette
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-06.png	the man called Shorty said, &quot;You were saying when
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-07.png	you came in that 2somep'n happened last
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-169/n06-169-08.png	night.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-00.png	&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;Something happened all right.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-01.png	After you'd left the meeting, mister&quot; - I
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-02.png	looked across at Nick Dowd - &quot;someone cut
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-03.png	down William Appleton outside the Palace
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-04.png	with a shotgun.&quot; I paused and watched my
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-05.png	words affect them in their different ways.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-06.png	&quot;That's sure bad news,&quot; said Dowd, sombrely.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-07.png	&quot;It 2jest about leaves everything wide open
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-08.png	for Mr. Pell and his bunch,&quot; observed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-175/n06-175-09.png	Shorty.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-00.png	The rest of the men there said nothing but
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-01.png	you could see they were hard hit. They were
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-02.png	simple men who knew a lot maybe about
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-03.png	digging for gold but were babes in arms
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-04.png	when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-05.png	desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-06.png	rest. &quot;I guess we'd better hold onto the gold
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-182/n06-182-07.png	right 2hyar, Nick,&quot; said the Sodbuster.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-00.png	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Dowd dubiously. &quot;2Mebbe we'd
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-01.png	better.&quot; Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-02.png	that point. &quot;If you do,&quot; he said, &quot;you'll be
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-03.png	sure asking for trouble. They'll be on your
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-04.png	necks before you can say 'knife'. It wouldn't
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-05.png	be the first time they've held up a diggings
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-06.png	at gun point either. They've done it before
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-186/n06-186-07.png	and got away with it.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-00.png	"You're 2durned tootin', mister," said the man
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-01.png	called Roper Smith. "We've got five rifles among
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-02.png	us and a few six-shooters. But most of us
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-03.png	2ain't 2eddicated in shootin'. It'd be a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-04.png	2massacree, 2yessir." "If you'll take a chance
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-05.png	on getting your gold to the bank, then we'll
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-06.png	abide by what we said at the meeting,"
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-194/n06-194-07.png	said Dan. "We'll watch the stage out of reach."
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-00.png	I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-01.png	with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-02.png	on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-03.png	handsome offer so I chimed in too. &quot;That
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-04.png	goes for me, gentlemen,&quot; I said. &quot;If they do try
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-05.png	and hold up the stage, it'll be a couple or
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-06.png	three of them, no more. I reckon we can deal
dataset/iam_lines/data/n06/n06-201/n06-201-07.png	with them all right.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-00.png	He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-01.png	naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-02.png	on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-03.png	at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-04.png	the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-036/n01-036-05.png	was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-00.png	They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-01.png	on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-02.png	He was able to trace the course of the river; he
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-03.png	thought he could recognise the route of N12,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-04.png	along which he had motored so desperately little
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-05.png	more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-06.png	he had flown to England, attended the vital
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-07.png	conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-08.png	by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-09.png	Parade to Boscombe Down, slept for six blessed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-10.png	refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-11.png	of the journey back to the place where every
dataset/iam_lines/data/n01/n01-052/n01-052-12.png	indication pointed to Eve being held.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-00.png	Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-01.png	white spray could be seen flying across the distance
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-02.png	of a mile and a half, came the yawl under her full
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-03.png	triangular sail, and to the judge's frightened eyes, so
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-04.png	close to the rocks that it would be dashed
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-064/n03-064-05.png	against them with the lift of the next wave.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-00.png	&quot;My God!&quot; the judge cried out. &quot;The boy
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-01.png	is going to try to make a landing on the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-02.png	weather side of that pier! He'll wreck!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-03.png	Willie Kim was speechless, only his slant
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-04.png	black eyes showing any emotion. With a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-05.png	quick shift of tiller, and at the same time
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-06.png	jibbing the boom to which he had the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-07.png	stay rope fastened, Bill made the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-097/n03-097-08.png	yawl recover.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-00.png	It seemed to the frightened judge
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-01.png	as though his son would actually
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-02.png	shoot the craft in under the outer
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-03.png	end of the wharf. But by pressing
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-04.png	the tiller hard over and at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-05.png	same time dropping the small sheet
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-06.png	of wet canvas, Bill cleared the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-07.png	corner of the pier by inches, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-08.png	with the tiller still hard over, brought
dataset/iam_lines/data/n03/n03-103/n03-103-09.png	the yawl up against the waves
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-00.png	&quot;Oh, the Press,&quot; said Seaweed. &quot;Down here on business, Mr.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-01.png	Bawley?&quot; &quot;A pressman is always on the job.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-02.png	He held out his hand and John could not do
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-03.png	otherwise than take it. &quot;Pleased to meet you,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-04.png	Commander,&quot; he said. &quot;Now what about that
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-05.png	drink?&quot; John nodded - he could afford to buy
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-084/n04-084-06.png	one in return and he was lonely.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-00.png	&quot;For the sake of accuracy,&quot; he said, &quot;and I
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-01.png	know how you newspaper people value that commodity! -
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-02.png	please don't address me as Commander. I'm
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-03.png	a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-04.png	drop the rank - such a mouthful!&quot; &quot;You're
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-05.png	absolutely right,&quot; said Bawley, as he pushed over
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-06.png	his glass. &quot;Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-07.png	all else. We pride ourselves about accuracy on
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-092/n04-092-08.png	the Courier.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-00.png	Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service?
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-01.png	Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-02.png	Somewhat embarrassing, what?&quot; &quot;How can the
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-03.png	truth be embarrassing?&quot; John sipped his double
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-04.png	gin with relish. It was his favourite brand,
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-05.png	he was on the verge of a new chapter in
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-06.png	his career, and his companion's attitude was
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-100/n04-100-07.png	challenging.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-00.png	Life at home and in Bath had been a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-01.png	trifle too comfortable and humdrum.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-02.png	He'd never before met a pressman and
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-03.png	found him curiously stimulating. "You're a
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-04.png	bit of a humorist, aren't you?" said
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-05.png	Bawley. "The truth is usually very embarra-
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-06.png	ssing. You're in submarines, aren't you?"
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-07.png	"You know a great deal about me,"
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-107/n04-107-08.png	said John.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-00.png	"It's my business. I'll tell you more. You're
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-01.png	going to take over command of Pericles. Am I
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-02.png	right?" "Who told you?" "Little bird.
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-03.png	Other half?" John nodded. "On me." Bawley
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-04.png	shook his head. "All paid for by His Lordship,"
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-05.png	he said. "Expense account. You're a married
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-06.png	man with a couple of kids. Can't go wasting
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-07.png	your substance on a complete stranger. Set
dataset/iam_lines/data/n04/n04-114/n04-114-08.png	'em up, darling!"
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-00.png	Gay went out to the waiting
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-01.png	taxi, and then found that in
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-02.png	the excitement of meeting
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-03.png	Gavin she had left her sun-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-04.png	glasses on the veranda. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-05.png	went quickly back to fetch them.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-06.png	Gavin and the girl who had got
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-07.png	off the plane with him were talking.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-08.png	He was writing something in his
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-09.png	pocket-book, with a sick feeling
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-008/p02-008-10.png	of despair Gay knew that of course
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-00.png	All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-01.png	would never be jealous again, would even take Larry's advice and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-02.png	look the other way if need be. &quot;I say!&quot; Gavin was looking over her
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-03.png	shoulder. &quot;That's a pretty girl!&quot; Gay glanced behind her, &quot;Isn't she
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-027/p02-027-04.png	lovely, she's French, a very well known model I believe.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-00.png	Gay, a little puzzled, went through
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-01.png	to the bar. Doc and Lilyan were
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-02.png	sitting just inside having coffee.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-03.png	&quot;Come and join us and bring your
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-04.png	boy friend,&quot; Doc called. &quot;No, Doc!&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-05.png	Lilyan remonstrated. &quot;They want to be
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-06.png	alone.&quot; &quot;I've booked a table at the
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-07.png	cafe*?2,&quot; Doc said, &quot;they are packed
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-08.png	tonight so come and join us if you
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-069/p02-069-09.png	can't find a table for two.&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-00.png	The others were all dancing and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-01.png	as Gay drew out a chair and sat
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-02.png	down Gavin, without a word, swept
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-03.png	Simone on to the floor. &quot;It doesn't mean
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-04.png	anything,&quot; Gay told herself desperately,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-05.png	trying to understand Gavin's point of
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-06.png	view and remembering the advice
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-07.png	that Larry had given her, while she
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-090/p02-090-08.png	felt wretched beyond words.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-00.png	His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-01.png	taste but it was unkind beyond words. She fumbled
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-02.png	with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-03.png	not wanting to smoke but needing some action
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-04.png	to help her control her feelings. &quot;Come and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-05.png	dance,&quot; Doc's cheery voice came as a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-06.png	lifeline and Gay got up quickly, mana-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-101/p02-101-07.png	ging a smile.

dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-04.png	may consider him a man, I would say he was a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-05.png	mentally adolescent cad." "Oh, Doc ..." Gay protested
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-06.png	weakly, "you don't know Gavin." "I've only met him
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-07.png	today but I think I can safely say that I know
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-109/p02-109-08.png	him a great deal better than you do."
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-00.png	Gay nodded. "I know that you're right Doc, I think
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-01.png	now that I do realise that, and in any case," she added
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-02.png	a little sadly, "if I did change Gavin, he wouldn't
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-03.png	be the same, if you know what I mean." "You sound
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-04.png	like Alice in Wonderland," Doc gently mocked her, "and
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-05.png	I'm glad you're beginning to see that you're wasting
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-127/p02-127-06.png	your time on that chap.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-00.png	Now let him go and you won't have to wait
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-01.png	long for the right man for you to come
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-02.png	along. If I was thirty years younger and weren't

dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-04.png	I'd marry you myself.&quot; Gay laughed, Doc was
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-05.png	so kind and nice and she hoped that one
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-06.png	day she would be able to see the situation
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-131/p02-131-07.png	as it obviously appeared to everyone else.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-00.png	&quot;So glad that you are having such a lovely time, dearie,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-01.png	it ran. &quot;Your cards are lovely. I rang up Miss Harland
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-02.png	and have been over to sit with her father and do what
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-03.png	I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-04.png	He's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
dataset/iam_lines/data/p02/p02-139/p02-139-05.png	broken arm.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-00.png	&quot;Bless you! I hope Luke is suitably grateful, darling.&quot; &quot;Oh, well,&quot;
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-01.png	he shrugged diffidently, &quot;I like the work. One gets plenty

dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-03.png	Junior Medical Officer. &quot;You won't be free about nine, I
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-04.png	suppose, to meet me for supper somewhere?&quot; she had
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-033/p03-033-05.png	asked hopefully.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-00.png	Thus had they parted the previous evening and now
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-01.png	Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-02.png	alone. Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-03.png	doctor would be free during the day; tea was served
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-04.png	from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-05.png	room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-06.png	Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention,
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-07.png	she was convinced, or he would have granted her small request
dataset/iam_lines/data/p03/p03-185/p03-185-08.png	to be met at the gates.

dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-08.png	solely in the office. 'If the jacket

dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-013/r02-013-10.png	the Inspector had written, 'it may

dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-00.png	It was locked. Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-01.png	when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-02.png	of wads of paper. 'Cor!' he muttered aloud, 'there's
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-03.png	five thousand at least.' He felt in his jacket pocket
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-04.png	and pulled out a key ring. In succession he tried
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-05.png	his own briefcase key, a suitcase key and a
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-054/r02-054-06.png	device designed to lock typewriters.
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-00.png	They closed on a single bundle and, fumbling with
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-01.png	nervous excitement, he pulled it out. His eye
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-02.png	rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-03.png	side. 'Old fashioned fivers!' he muttered again, and
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-04.png	tried to recall if they were still legal tender. Surely the
dataset/iam_lines/data/r02/r02-065/r02-065-05.png	Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
